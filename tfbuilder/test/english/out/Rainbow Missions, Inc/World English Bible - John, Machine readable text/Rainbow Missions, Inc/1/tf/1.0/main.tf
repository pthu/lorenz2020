the
gospel
according
to
john
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
god
the
same
was
in
the
beginning
with
god
all
things
were
made
through
him
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
has
been
made
in
him
was
life
and
the
life
was
the
light
of
men
the
light
shines
in
the
darkness
and
the
darkness
hasn
t
overcome
it
there
came
a
man
sent
from
god
whose
name
was
john
the
same
came
as
a
witness
that
he
might
testify
about
the
light
that
all
might
believe
through
him
he
was
not
the
light
but
was
sent
that
he
might
testify
about
the
light
the
true
light
that
enlightens
everyone
was
coming
into
the
world
he
was
in
the
world
and
the
world
was
made
through
him
and
the
world
didn
t
recognize
him
he
came
to
his
own
and
those
who
were
his
own
didn
t
receive
him
but
as
many
as
received
him
to
them
he
gave
the
right
to
become
god
s
children
to
those
who
believe
in
his
name
who
were
born
not
of
blood
nor
of
the
will
of
the
flesh
nor
of
the
will
of
man
but
of
god
the
word
became
flesh
and
lived
among
us
we
saw
his
glory
such
glory
as
of
the
one
and
only
son
of
the
father
full
of
grace
and
truth
john
testified
about
him
he
cried
out
saying
this
was
he
of
whom
i
said
he
who
comes
after
me
has
surpassed
me
for
he
was
before
me
from
his
fullness
we
all
received
grace
upon
grace
for
the
law
was
given
through
moses
grace
and
truth
came
through
jesus
christ
no
one
has
seen
god
at
any
time
the
one
and
only
son
who
is
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
he
has
declared
him
this
is
john
s
testimony
when
the
jews
sent
priests
and
levites
from
jerusalem
to
ask
him
who
are
you
he
confessed
and
didn
t
deny
but
he
confessed
i
am
not
the
christ
they
asked
him
what
then
are
you
elijah
he
said
i
am
not
are
you
the
prophet
he
answered
no
they
said
therefore
to
him
who
are
you
give
us
an
answer
to
take
back
to
those
who
sent
us
what
do
you
say
about
yourself
he
said
i
am
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
make
straight
the
way
of
the
lord
as
isaiah
the
prophet
said
the
ones
who
had
been
sent
were
from
the
pharisees
they
asked
him
why
then
do
you
baptize
if
you
are
not
the
christ
nor
elijah
nor
the
prophet
john
answered
them
i
baptize
in
water
but
among
you
stands
one
whom
you
don
t
know
he
is
the
one
who
comes
after
me
who
has
come
to
be
before
me
whose
sandal
strap
i
m
not
worthy
to
untie
these
things
were
done
in
bethany
beyond
the
jordan
where
john
was
baptizing
the
next
day
he
saw
jesus
coming
to
him
and
said
behold
the
lamb
of
god
who
takes
away
the
sin
of
the
world
this
is
he
of
whom
i
said
after
me
comes
a
man
who
is
preferred
before
me
for
he
was
before
me
i
didn
t
know
him
but
for
this
reason
i
came
baptizing
in
water
that
he
would
be
revealed
to
israel
john
testified
saying
i
have
seen
the
spirit
descending
like
a
dove
out
of
heaven
and
it
remained
on
him
i
didn
t
recognize
him
but
he
who
sent
me
to
baptize
in
water
he
said
to
me
on
whomever
you
will
see
the
spirit
descending
and
remaining
on
him
the
same
is
he
who
baptizes
in
the
holy
spirit
i
have
seen
and
have
testified
that
this
is
the
son
of
god
again
the
next
day
john
was
standing
with
two
of
his
disciples
and
he
looked
at
jesus
as
he
walked
and
said
behold
the
lamb
of
god
the
two
disciples
heard
him
speak
and
they
followed
jesus
jesus
turned
and
saw
them
following
and
said
to
them
what
are
you
looking
for
they
said
to
him
rabbi
which
is
to
say
being
interpreted
teacher
where
are
you
staying
he
said
to
them
come
and
see
they
came
and
saw
where
he
was
staying
and
they
stayed
with
him
that
day
it
was
about
the
tenth
hour
one
of
the
two
who
heard
john
and
followed
him
was
andrew
simon
peter
s
brother
he
first
found
his
own
brother
simon
and
said
to
him
we
have
found
the
messiah
which
is
being
interpreted
christ
he
brought
him
to
jesus
jesus
looked
at
him
and
said
you
are
simon
the
son
of
jonah
you
shall
be
called
cephas
which
is
by
interpretation
peter
on
the
next
day
he
was
determined
to
go
out
into
galilee
and
he
found
philip
jesus
said
to
him
follow
me
now
philip
was
from
bethsaida
of
the
city
of
andrew
and
peter
philip
found
nathanael
and
said
to
him
we
have
found
him
of
whom
moses
in
the
law
and
the
prophets
wrote
jesus
of
nazareth
the
son
of
joseph
nathanael
said
to
him
can
any
good
thing
come
out
of
nazareth
philip
said
to
him
come
and
see
jesus
saw
nathanael
coming
to
him
and
said
about
him
behold
an
israelite
indeed
in
whom
is
no
deceit
nathanael
said
to
him
how
do
you
know
me
jesus
answered
him
before
philip
called
you
when
you
were
under
the
fig
tree
i
saw
you
nathanael
answered
him
rabbi
you
are
the
son
of
god
you
are
king
of
israel
jesus
answered
him
because
i
told
you
i
saw
you
underneath
the
fig
tree
do
you
believe
you
will
see
greater
things
than
these
he
said
to
him
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
hereafter
you
will
see
heaven
opened
and
the
angels
of
god
ascending
and
descending
on
the
son
of
man
the
third
day
there
was
a
marriage
in
cana
of
galilee
jesus
mother
was
there
jesus
also
was
invited
with
his
disciples
to
the
marriage
when
the
wine
ran
out
jesus
mother
said
to
him
they
have
no
wine
jesus
said
to
her
woman
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
you
and
me
my
hour
has
not
yet
come
his
mother
said
to
the
servants
whatever
he
says
to
you
do
it
now
there
were
six
water
pots
of
stone
set
there
after
the
jews
manner
of
purifying
containing
two
or
three
metretes
apiece
jesus
said
to
them
fill
the
water
pots
with
water
they
filled
them
up
to
the
brim
he
said
to
them
now
draw
some
out
and
take
it
to
the
ruler
of
the
feast
so
they
took
it
when
the
ruler
of
the
feast
tasted
the
water
now
become
wine
and
didn
t
know
where
it
came
from
but
the
servants
who
had
drawn
the
water
knew
the
ruler
of
the
feast
called
the
bridegroom
and
said
to
him
everyone
serves
the
good
wine
first
and
when
the
guests
have
drunk
freely
then
that
which
is
worse
you
have
kept
the
good
wine
until
now
this
beginning
of
his
signs
jesus
did
in
cana
of
galilee
and
revealed
his
glory
and
his
disciples
believed
in
him
after
this
he
went
down
to
capernaum
he
and
his
mother
his
brothers
and
his
disciples
and
they
stayed
there
a
few
days
the
passover
of
the
jews
was
at
hand
and
jesus
went
up
to
jerusalem
he
found
in
the
temple
those
who
sold
oxen
sheep
and
doves
and
the
changers
of
money
sitting
he
made
a
whip
of
cords
and
threw
all
out
of
the
temple
both
the
sheep
and
the
oxen
and
he
poured
out
the
changers
money
and
overthrew
their
tables
to
those
who
sold
the
doves
he
said
take
these
things
out
of
here
don
t
make
my
father
s
house
a
marketplace
his
disciples
remembered
that
it
was
written
zeal
for
your
house
will
eat
me
up
the
jews
therefore
answered
him
what
sign
do
you
show
us
seeing
that
you
do
these
things
jesus
answered
them
destroy
this
temple
and
in
three
days
i
will
raise
it
up
the
jews
therefore
said
fortysix
years
was
this
temple
in
building
and
will
you
raise
it
up
in
three
days
but
he
spoke
of
the
temple
of
his
body
when
therefore
he
was
raised
from
the
dead
his
disciples
remembered
that
he
said
this
and
they
believed
the
scripture
and
the
word
which
jesus
had
said
now
when
he
was
in
jerusalem
at
the
passover
during
the
feast
many
believed
in
his
name
observing
his
signs
which
he
did
but
jesus
didn
t
trust
himself
to
them
because
he
knew
everyone
and
because
he
didn
t
need
for
anyone
to
testify
concerning
man
for
he
himself
knew
what
was
in
man
now
there
was
a
man
of
the
pharisees
named
nicodemus
a
ruler
of
the
jews
the
same
came
to
him
by
night
and
said
to
him
rabbi
we
know
that
you
are
a
teacher
come
from
god
for
no
one
can
do
these
signs
that
you
do
unless
god
is
with
him
jesus
answered
him
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
unless
one
is
born
anew
he
can
t
see
the
kingdom
of
god
nicodemus
said
to
him
how
can
a
man
be
born
when
he
is
old
can
he
enter
a
second
time
into
his
mother
s
womb
and
be
born
jesus
answered
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
unless
one
is
born
of
water
and
spirit
he
can
t
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
don
t
marvel
that
i
said
to
you
you
must
be
born
anew
the
wind
blows
where
it
wants
to
and
you
hear
its
sound
but
don
t
know
where
it
comes
from
and
where
it
is
going
so
is
everyone
who
is
born
of
the
spirit
nicodemus
answered
him
how
can
these
things
be
jesus
answered
him
are
you
the
teacher
of
israel
and
don
t
understand
these
things
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
we
speak
that
which
we
know
and
testify
of
that
which
we
have
seen
and
you
don
t
receive
our
witness
if
i
told
you
earthly
things
and
you
don
t
believe
how
will
you
believe
if
i
tell
you
heavenly
things
no
one
has
ascended
into
heaven
but
he
who
descended
out
of
heaven
the
son
of
man
who
is
in
heaven
as
moses
lifted
up
the
serpent
in
the
wilderness
even
so
must
the
son
of
man
be
lifted
up
that
whoever
believes
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
eternal
life
for
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
one
and
only
son
that
whoever
believes
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
eternal
life
for
god
didn
t
send
his
son
into
the
world
to
judge
the
world
but
that
the
world
should
be
saved
through
him
he
who
believes
in
him
is
not
judged
he
who
doesn
t
believe
has
been
judged
already
because
he
has
not
believed
in
the
name
of
the
only
born
son
of
god
this
is
the
judgment
that
the
light
has
come
into
the
world
and
men
loved
the
darkness
rather
than
the
light
for
their
works
were
evil
for
everyone
who
does
evil
hates
the
light
and
doesn
t
come
to
the
light
lest
his
works
would
be
exposed
but
he
who
does
the
truth
comes
to
the
light
that
his
works
may
be
revealed
that
they
have
been
done
in
god
after
these
things
jesus
came
with
his
disciples
into
the
land
of
judea
he
stayed
there
with
them
and
baptized
john
also
was
baptizing
in
enon
near
salim
because
there
was
much
water
there
they
came
and
were
baptized
for
john
was
not
yet
thrown
into
prison
there
arose
therefore
a
questioning
on
the
part
of
john
s
disciples
with
some
jews
about
purification
they
came
to
john
and
said
to
him
rabbi
he
who
was
with
you
beyond
the
jordan
to
whom
you
have
testified
behold
the
same
baptizes
and
everyone
is
coming
to
him
john
answered
a
man
can
receive
nothing
unless
it
has
been
given
him
from
heaven
you
yourselves
testify
that
i
said
i
am
not
the
christ
but
i
have
been
sent
before
him
he
who
has
the
bride
is
the
bridegroom
but
the
friend
of
the
bridegroom
who
stands
and
hears
him
rejoices
greatly
because
of
the
bridegroom
s
voice
this
my
joy
therefore
is
made
full
he
must
increase
but
i
must
decrease
he
who
comes
from
above
is
above
all
he
who
is
from
the
earth
belongs
to
the
earth
and
speaks
of
the
earth
he
who
comes
from
heaven
is
above
all
what
he
has
seen
and
heard
of
that
he
testifies
and
no
one
receives
his
witness
he
who
has
received
his
witness
has
set
his
seal
to
this
that
god
is
true
for
he
whom
god
has
sent
speaks
the
words
of
god
for
god
gives
the
spirit
without
measure
the
father
loves
the
son
and
has
given
all
things
into
his
hand
one
who
believes
in
the
son
has
eternal
life
but
one
who
disobeys
the
son
won
t
see
life
but
the
wrath
of
god
remains
on
him
therefore
when
the
lord
knew
that
the
pharisees
had
heard
that
jesus
was
making
and
baptizing
more
disciples
than
john
although
jesus
himself
didn
t
baptize
but
his
disciples
he
left
judea
and
departed
into
galilee
he
needed
to
pass
through
samaria
so
he
came
to
a
city
of
samaria
called
sychar
near
the
parcel
of
ground
that
jacob
gave
to
his
son
joseph
jacob
s
well
was
there
jesus
therefore
being
tired
from
his
journey
sat
down
by
the
well
it
was
about
the
sixth
hour
a
woman
of
samaria
came
to
draw
water
jesus
said
to
her
give
me
a
drink
for
his
disciples
had
gone
away
into
the
city
to
buy
food
the
samaritan
woman
therefore
said
to
him
how
is
it
that
you
being
a
jew
ask
for
a
drink
from
me
a
samaritan
woman
for
jews
have
no
dealings
with
samaritans
jesus
answered
her
if
you
knew
the
gift
of
god
and
who
it
is
who
says
to
you
give
me
a
drink
you
would
have
asked
him
and
he
would
have
given
you
living
water
the
woman
said
to
him
sir
you
have
nothing
to
draw
with
and
the
well
is
deep
from
where
then
have
you
that
living
water
are
you
greater
than
our
father
jacob
who
gave
us
the
well
and
drank
of
it
himself
as
did
his
sons
and
his
cattle
jesus
answered
her
everyone
who
drinks
of
this
water
will
thirst
again
but
whoever
drinks
of
the
water
that
i
will
give
him
will
never
thirst
again
but
the
water
that
i
will
give
him
will
become
in
him
a
well
of
water
springing
up
to
eternal
life
the
woman
said
to
him
sir
give
me
this
water
so
that
i
don
t
get
thirsty
neither
come
all
the
way
here
to
draw
jesus
said
to
her
go
call
your
husband
and
come
here
the
woman
answered
i
have
no
husband
jesus
said
to
her
you
said
well
i
have
no
husband
for
you
have
had
five
husbands
and
he
whom
you
now
have
is
not
your
husband
this
you
have
said
truly
the
woman
said
to
him
sir
i
perceive
that
you
are
a
prophet
our
fathers
worshiped
in
this
mountain
and
you
jews
say
that
in
jerusalem
is
the
place
where
people
ought
to
worship
jesus
said
to
her
woman
believe
me
the
hour
comes
when
neither
in
this
mountain
nor
in
jerusalem
will
you
worship
the
father
you
worship
that
which
you
don
t
know
we
worship
that
which
we
know
for
salvation
is
from
the
jews
but
the
hour
comes
and
now
is
when
the
true
worshippers
will
worship
the
father
in
spirit
and
truth
for
the
father
seeks
such
to
be
his
worshippers
god
is
spirit
and
those
who
worship
him
must
worship
in
spirit
and
truth
the
woman
said
to
him
i
know
that
messiah
comes
he
who
is
called
christ
when
he
has
come
he
will
declare
to
us
all
things
jesus
said
to
her
i
am
he
the
one
who
speaks
to
you
at
this
his
disciples
came
they
marveled
that
he
was
speaking
with
a
woman
yet
no
one
said
what
are
you
looking
for
or
why
do
you
speak
with
her
so
the
woman
left
her
water
pot
and
went
away
into
the
city
and
said
to
the
people
come
see
a
man
who
told
me
everything
that
i
did
can
this
be
the
christ
they
went
out
of
the
city
and
were
coming
to
him
in
the
meanwhile
the
disciples
urged
him
saying
rabbi
eat
but
he
said
to
them
i
have
food
to
eat
that
you
don
t
know
about
the
disciples
therefore
said
one
to
another
has
anyone
brought
him
something
to
eat
jesus
said
to
them
my
food
is
to
do
the
will
of
him
who
sent
me
and
to
accomplish
his
work
don
t
you
say
there
are
yet
four
months
until
the
harvest
behold
i
tell
you
lift
up
your
eyes
and
look
at
the
fields
that
they
are
white
for
harvest
already
he
who
reaps
receives
wages
and
gathers
fruit
to
eternal
life
that
both
he
who
sows
and
he
who
reaps
may
rejoice
together
for
in
this
the
saying
is
true
one
sows
and
another
reaps
i
sent
you
to
reap
that
for
which
you
haven
t
labored
others
have
labored
and
you
have
entered
into
their
labor
from
that
city
many
of
the
samaritans
believed
in
him
because
of
the
word
of
the
woman
who
testified
he
told
me
everything
that
i
did
so
when
the
samaritans
came
to
him
they
begged
him
to
stay
with
them
he
stayed
there
two
days
many
more
believed
because
of
his
word
they
said
to
the
woman
now
we
believe
not
because
of
your
speaking
for
we
have
heard
for
ourselves
and
know
that
this
is
indeed
the
christ
the
savior
of
the
world
after
the
two
days
he
went
out
from
there
and
went
into
galilee
for
jesus
himself
testified
that
a
prophet
has
no
honor
in
his
own
country
so
when
he
came
into
galilee
the
galilaeans
received
him
having
seen
all
the
things
that
he
did
in
jerusalem
at
the
feast
for
they
also
went
to
the
feast
jesus
came
therefore
again
to
cana
of
galilee
where
he
made
the
water
into
wine
there
was
a
certain
nobleman
whose
son
was
sick
at
capernaum
when
he
heard
that
jesus
had
come
out
of
judea
into
galilee
he
went
to
him
and
begged
him
that
he
would
come
down
and
heal
his
son
for
he
was
at
the
point
of
death
jesus
therefore
said
to
him
unless
you
see
signs
and
wonders
you
will
in
no
way
believe
the
nobleman
said
to
him
sir
come
down
before
my
child
dies
jesus
said
to
him
go
your
way
your
son
lives
the
man
believed
the
word
that
jesus
spoke
to
him
and
he
went
his
way
as
he
was
now
going
down
his
servants
met
him
and
reported
saying
your
child
lives
so
he
inquired
of
them
the
hour
when
he
began
to
get
better
they
said
therefore
to
him
yesterday
at
the
seventh
hour
the
fever
left
him
so
the
father
knew
that
it
was
at
that
hour
in
which
jesus
said
to
him
your
son
lives
he
believed
as
did
his
whole
house
this
is
again
the
second
sign
that
jesus
did
having
come
out
of
judea
into
galilee
after
these
things
there
was
a
feast
of
the
jews
and
jesus
went
up
to
jerusalem
now
in
jerusalem
by
the
sheep
gate
there
is
a
pool
which
is
called
in
hebrew
bethesda
having
five
porches
in
these
lay
a
great
multitude
of
those
who
were
sick
blind
lame
or
paralyzed
waiting
for
the
moving
of
the
water
for
an
angel
of
the
lord
went
down
at
certain
times
into
the
pool
and
stirred
up
the
water
whoever
stepped
in
first
after
the
stirring
of
the
water
was
made
whole
of
whatever
disease
he
had
a
certain
man
was
there
who
had
been
sick
for
thirtyeight
years
when
jesus
saw
him
lying
there
and
knew
that
he
had
been
sick
for
a
long
time
he
asked
him
do
you
want
to
be
made
well
the
sick
man
answered
him
sir
i
have
no
one
to
put
me
into
the
pool
when
the
water
is
stirred
up
but
while
i
m
coming
another
steps
down
before
me
jesus
said
to
him
arise
take
up
your
mat
and
walk
immediately
the
man
was
made
well
and
took
up
his
mat
and
walked
now
it
was
the
sabbath
on
that
day
so
the
jews
said
to
him
who
was
cured
it
is
the
sabbath
it
is
not
lawful
for
you
to
carry
the
mat
he
answered
them
he
who
made
me
well
the
same
said
to
me
take
up
your
mat
and
walk
then
they
asked
him
who
is
the
man
who
said
to
you
take
up
your
mat
and
walk
but
he
who
was
healed
didn
t
know
who
it
was
for
jesus
had
withdrawn
a
crowd
being
in
the
place
afterward
jesus
found
him
in
the
temple
and
said
to
him
behold
you
are
made
well
sin
no
more
so
that
nothing
worse
happens
to
you
the
man
went
away
and
told
the
jews
that
it
was
jesus
who
had
made
him
well
for
this
cause
the
jews
persecuted
jesus
and
sought
to
kill
him
because
he
did
these
things
on
the
sabbath
but
jesus
answered
them
my
father
is
still
working
so
i
am
working
too
for
this
cause
therefore
the
jews
sought
all
the
more
to
kill
him
because
he
not
only
broke
the
sabbath
but
also
called
god
his
own
father
making
himself
equal
with
god
jesus
therefore
answered
them
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
the
son
can
do
nothing
of
himself
but
what
he
sees
the
father
doing
for
whatever
things
he
does
these
the
son
also
does
likewise
for
the
father
has
affection
for
the
son
and
shows
him
all
things
that
he
himself
does
he
will
show
him
greater
works
than
these
that
you
may
marvel
for
as
the
father
raises
the
dead
and
gives
them
life
even
so
the
son
also
gives
life
to
whom
he
desires
for
the
father
judges
no
one
but
he
has
given
all
judgment
to
the
son
that
all
may
honor
the
son
even
as
they
honor
the
father
he
who
doesn
t
honor
the
son
doesn
t
honor
the
father
who
sent
him
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
he
who
hears
my
word
and
believes
him
who
sent
me
has
eternal
life
and
doesn
t
come
into
judgment
but
has
passed
out
of
death
into
life
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
the
hour
comes
and
now
is
when
the
dead
will
hear
the
son
of
god
s
voice
and
those
who
hear
will
live
for
as
the
father
has
life
in
himself
even
so
he
gave
to
the
son
also
to
have
life
in
himself
he
also
gave
him
authority
to
execute
judgment
because
he
is
a
son
of
man
don
t
marvel
at
this
for
the
hour
comes
in
which
all
that
are
in
the
tombs
will
hear
his
voice
and
will
come
out
those
who
have
done
good
to
the
resurrection
of
life
and
those
who
have
done
evil
to
the
resurrection
of
judgment
i
can
of
myself
do
nothing
as
i
hear
i
judge
and
my
judgment
is
righteous
because
i
don
t
seek
my
own
will
but
the
will
of
my
father
who
sent
me
if
i
testify
about
myself
my
witness
is
not
valid
it
is
another
who
testifies
about
me
i
know
that
the
testimony
which
he
testifies
about
me
is
true
you
have
sent
to
john
and
he
has
testified
to
the
truth
but
the
testimony
which
i
receive
is
not
from
man
however
i
say
these
things
that
you
may
be
saved
he
was
the
burning
and
shining
lamp
and
you
were
willing
to
rejoice
for
a
while
in
his
light
but
the
testimony
which
i
have
is
greater
than
that
of
john
for
the
works
which
the
father
gave
me
to
accomplish
the
very
works
that
i
do
testify
about
me
that
the
father
has
sent
me
the
father
himself
who
sent
me
has
testified
about
me
you
have
neither
heard
his
voice
at
any
time
nor
seen
his
form
you
don
t
have
his
word
living
in
you
because
you
don
t
believe
him
whom
he
sent
you
search
the
scriptures
because
you
think
that
in
them
you
have
eternal
life
and
these
are
they
which
testify
about
me
yet
you
will
not
come
to
me
that
you
may
have
life
i
don
t
receive
glory
from
men
but
i
know
you
that
you
don
t
have
god
s
love
in
yourselves
i
have
come
in
my
father
s
name
and
you
don
t
receive
me
if
another
comes
in
his
own
name
you
will
receive
him
how
can
you
believe
who
receive
glory
from
one
another
and
you
don
t
seek
the
glory
that
comes
from
the
only
god
don
t
think
that
i
will
accuse
you
to
the
father
there
is
one
who
accuses
you
even
moses
on
whom
you
have
set
your
hope
for
if
you
believed
moses
you
would
believe
me
for
he
wrote
about
me
but
if
you
don
t
believe
his
writings
how
will
you
believe
my
words
after
these
things
jesus
went
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
sea
of
galilee
which
is
also
called
the
sea
of
tiberias
a
great
multitude
followed
him
because
they
saw
his
signs
which
he
did
on
those
who
were
sick
jesus
went
up
into
the
mountain
and
he
sat
there
with
his
disciples
now
the
passover
the
feast
of
the
jews
was
at
hand
jesus
therefore
lifting
up
his
eyes
and
seeing
that
a
great
multitude
was
coming
to
him
said
to
philip
where
are
we
to
buy
bread
that
these
may
eat
this
he
said
to
test
him
for
he
himself
knew
what
he
would
do
philip
answered
him
two
hundred
denarii
worth
of
bread
is
not
sufficient
for
them
that
everyone
of
them
may
receive
a
little
one
of
his
disciples
andrew
simon
peter
s
brother
said
to
him
there
is
a
boy
here
who
has
five
barley
loaves
and
two
fish
but
what
are
these
among
so
many
jesus
said
have
the
people
sit
down
now
there
was
much
grass
in
that
place
so
the
men
sat
down
in
number
about
five
thousand
jesus
took
the
loaves
and
having
given
thanks
he
distributed
to
the
disciples
and
the
disciples
to
those
who
were
sitting
down
likewise
also
of
the
fish
as
much
as
they
desired
when
they
were
filled
he
said
to
his
disciples
gather
up
the
broken
pieces
which
are
left
over
that
nothing
be
lost
so
they
gathered
them
up
and
filled
twelve
baskets
with
broken
pieces
from
the
five
barley
loaves
which
were
left
over
by
those
who
had
eaten
when
therefore
the
people
saw
the
sign
which
jesus
did
they
said
this
is
truly
the
prophet
who
comes
into
the
world
jesus
therefore
perceiving
that
they
were
about
to
come
and
take
him
by
force
to
make
him
king
withdrew
again
to
the
mountain
by
himself
when
evening
came
his
disciples
went
down
to
the
sea
and
they
entered
into
the
boat
and
were
going
over
the
sea
to
capernaum
it
was
now
dark
and
jesus
had
not
come
to
them
the
sea
was
tossed
by
a
great
wind
blowing
when
therefore
they
had
rowed
about
twentyfive
or
thirty
stadia
they
saw
jesus
walking
on
the
sea
and
drawing
near
to
the
boat
and
they
were
afraid
but
he
said
to
them
i
am
don
t
be
afraid
they
were
willing
therefore
to
receive
him
into
the
boat
immediately
the
boat
was
at
the
land
where
they
were
going
on
the
next
day
the
multitude
that
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
saw
that
there
was
no
other
boat
there
except
the
one
in
which
his
disciples
had
embarked
and
that
jesus
hadn
t
entered
with
his
disciples
into
the
boat
but
his
disciples
had
gone
away
alone
however
boats
from
tiberias
came
near
to
the
place
where
they
ate
the
bread
after
the
lord
had
given
thanks
when
the
multitude
therefore
saw
that
jesus
wasn
t
there
nor
his
disciples
they
themselves
got
into
the
boats
and
came
to
capernaum
seeking
jesus
when
they
found
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
they
asked
him
rabbi
when
did
you
come
here
jesus
answered
them
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
you
seek
me
not
because
you
saw
signs
but
because
you
ate
of
the
loaves
and
were
filled
don
t
work
for
the
food
which
perishes
but
for
the
food
which
remains
to
eternal
life
which
the
son
of
man
will
give
to
you
for
god
the
father
has
sealed
him
they
said
therefore
to
him
what
must
we
do
that
we
may
work
the
works
of
god
jesus
answered
them
this
is
the
work
of
god
that
you
believe
in
him
whom
he
has
sent
they
said
therefore
to
him
what
then
do
you
do
for
a
sign
that
we
may
see
and
believe
you
what
work
do
you
do
our
fathers
ate
the
manna
in
the
wilderness
as
it
is
written
he
gave
them
bread
out
of
heaven
to
eat
jesus
therefore
said
to
them
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
it
wasn
t
moses
who
gave
you
the
bread
out
of
heaven
but
my
father
gives
you
the
true
bread
out
of
heaven
for
the
bread
of
god
is
that
which
comes
down
out
of
heaven
and
gives
life
to
the
world
they
said
therefore
to
him
lord
always
give
us
this
bread
jesus
said
to
them
i
am
the
bread
of
life
he
who
comes
to
me
will
not
be
hungry
and
he
who
believes
in
me
will
never
be
thirsty
but
i
told
you
that
you
have
seen
me
and
yet
you
don
t
believe
all
those
who
the
father
gives
me
will
come
to
me
him
who
comes
to
me
i
will
in
no
way
throw
out
for
i
have
come
down
from
heaven
not
to
do
my
own
will
but
the
will
of
him
who
sent
me
this
is
the
will
of
my
father
who
sent
me
that
of
all
he
has
given
to
me
i
should
lose
nothing
but
should
raise
him
up
at
the
last
day
this
is
the
will
of
the
one
who
sent
me
that
everyone
who
sees
the
son
and
believes
in
him
should
have
eternal
life
and
i
will
raise
him
up
at
the
last
day
the
jews
therefore
murmured
concerning
him
because
he
said
i
am
the
bread
which
came
down
out
of
heaven
they
said
isn
t
this
jesus
the
son
of
joseph
whose
father
and
mother
we
know
how
then
does
he
say
i
have
come
down
out
of
heaven
therefore
jesus
answered
them
don
t
murmur
among
yourselves
no
one
can
come
to
me
unless
the
father
who
sent
me
draws
him
and
i
will
raise
him
up
in
the
last
day
it
is
written
in
the
prophets
they
will
all
be
taught
by
god
therefore
everyone
who
hears
from
the
father
and
has
learned
comes
to
me
not
that
anyone
has
seen
the
father
except
he
who
is
from
god
he
has
seen
the
father
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
he
who
believes
in
me
has
eternal
life
i
am
the
bread
of
life
your
fathers
ate
the
manna
in
the
wilderness
and
they
died
this
is
the
bread
which
comes
down
out
of
heaven
that
anyone
may
eat
of
it
and
not
die
i
am
the
living
bread
which
came
down
out
of
heaven
if
anyone
eats
of
this
bread
he
will
live
forever
yes
the
bread
which
i
will
give
for
the
life
of
the
world
is
my
flesh
the
jews
therefore
contended
with
one
another
saying
how
can
this
man
give
us
his
flesh
to
eat
jesus
therefore
said
to
them
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
unless
you
eat
the
flesh
of
the
son
of
man
and
drink
his
blood
you
don
t
have
life
in
yourselves
he
who
eats
my
flesh
and
drinks
my
blood
has
eternal
life
and
i
will
raise
him
up
at
the
last
day
for
my
flesh
is
food
indeed
and
my
blood
is
drink
indeed
he
who
eats
my
flesh
and
drinks
my
blood
lives
in
me
and
i
in
him
as
the
living
father
sent
me
and
i
live
because
of
the
father
so
he
who
feeds
on
me
he
will
also
live
because
of
me
this
is
the
bread
which
came
down
out
of
heaven
not
as
our
fathers
ate
the
manna
and
died
he
who
eats
this
bread
will
live
forever
these
things
he
said
in
the
synagogue
as
he
taught
in
capernaum
therefore
many
of
his
disciples
when
they
heard
this
said
this
is
a
hard
saying
who
can
listen
to
it
but
jesus
knowing
in
himself
that
his
disciples
murmured
at
this
said
to
them
does
this
cause
you
to
stumble
then
what
if
you
would
see
the
son
of
man
ascending
to
where
he
was
before
it
is
the
spirit
who
gives
life
the
flesh
profits
nothing
the
words
that
i
speak
to
you
are
spirit
and
are
life
but
there
are
some
of
you
who
don
t
believe
for
jesus
knew
from
the
beginning
who
they
were
who
didn
t
believe
and
who
it
was
who
would
betray
him
he
said
for
this
cause
have
i
said
to
you
that
no
one
can
come
to
me
unless
it
is
given
to
him
by
my
father
at
this
many
of
his
disciples
went
back
and
walked
no
more
with
him
jesus
said
therefore
to
the
twelve
you
don
t
also
want
to
go
away
do
you
simon
peter
answered
him
lord
to
whom
would
we
go
you
have
the
words
of
eternal
life
we
have
come
to
believe
and
know
that
you
are
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
he
answered
them
didn
t
i
choose
you
the
twelve
and
one
of
you
is
a
devil
now
he
spoke
of
judas
the
son
of
simon
iscariot
for
it
was
he
who
would
betray
him
being
one
of
the
twelve
after
these
things
jesus
was
walking
in
galilee
for
he
wouldn
t
walk
in
judea
because
the
jews
sought
to
kill
him
now
the
feast
of
the
jews
the
feast
of
booths
was
at
hand
his
brothers
therefore
said
to
him
depart
from
here
and
go
into
judea
that
your
disciples
also
may
see
your
works
which
you
do
for
no
one
does
anything
in
secret
and
himself
seeks
to
be
known
openly
if
you
do
these
things
reveal
yourself
to
the
world
for
even
his
brothers
didn
t
believe
in
him
jesus
therefore
said
to
them
my
time
has
not
yet
come
but
your
time
is
always
ready
the
world
can
t
hate
you
but
it
hates
me
because
i
testify
about
it
that
its
works
are
evil
you
go
up
to
the
feast
i
am
not
yet
going
up
to
this
feast
because
my
time
is
not
yet
fulfilled
having
said
these
things
to
them
he
stayed
in
galilee
but
when
his
brothers
had
gone
up
to
the
feast
then
he
also
went
up
not
publicly
but
as
it
were
in
secret
the
jews
therefore
sought
him
at
the
feast
and
said
where
is
he
there
was
much
murmuring
among
the
multitudes
concerning
him
some
said
he
is
a
good
man
others
said
not
so
but
he
leads
the
multitude
astray
yet
no
one
spoke
openly
of
him
for
fear
of
the
jews
but
when
it
was
now
the
midst
of
the
feast
jesus
went
up
into
the
temple
and
taught
the
jews
therefore
marveled
saying
how
does
this
man
know
letters
having
never
been
educated
jesus
therefore
answered
them
my
teaching
is
not
mine
but
his
who
sent
me
if
anyone
desires
to
do
his
will
he
will
know
about
the
teaching
whether
it
is
from
god
or
if
i
am
speaking
from
myself
he
who
speaks
from
himself
seeks
his
own
glory
but
he
who
seeks
the
glory
of
him
who
sent
him
the
same
is
true
and
no
unrighteousness
is
in
him
didn
t
moses
give
you
the
law
and
yet
none
of
you
keeps
the
law
why
do
you
seek
to
kill
me
the
multitude
answered
you
have
a
demon
who
seeks
to
kill
you
jesus
answered
them
i
did
one
work
and
you
all
marvel
because
of
it
moses
has
given
you
circumcision
not
that
it
is
of
moses
but
of
the
fathers
and
on
the
sabbath
you
circumcise
a
boy
if
a
boy
receives
circumcision
on
the
sabbath
that
the
law
of
moses
may
not
be
broken
are
you
angry
with
me
because
i
made
a
man
every
bit
whole
on
the
sabbath
don
t
judge
according
to
appearance
but
judge
righteous
judgment
therefore
some
of
them
of
jerusalem
said
isn
t
this
he
whom
they
seek
to
kill
behold
he
speaks
openly
and
they
say
nothing
to
him
can
it
be
that
the
rulers
indeed
know
that
this
is
truly
the
christ
however
we
know
where
this
man
comes
from
but
when
the
christ
comes
no
one
will
know
where
he
comes
from
jesus
therefore
cried
out
in
the
temple
teaching
and
saying
you
both
know
me
and
know
where
i
am
from
i
have
not
come
of
myself
but
he
who
sent
me
is
true
whom
you
don
t
know
i
know
him
because
i
am
from
him
and
he
sent
me
they
sought
therefore
to
take
him
but
no
one
laid
a
hand
on
him
because
his
hour
had
not
yet
come
but
of
the
multitude
many
believed
in
him
they
said
when
the
christ
comes
he
won
t
do
more
signs
than
those
which
this
man
has
done
will
he
the
pharisees
heard
the
multitude
murmuring
these
things
concerning
him
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
pharisees
sent
officers
to
arrest
him
then
jesus
said
i
will
be
with
you
a
little
while
longer
then
i
go
to
him
who
sent
me
you
will
seek
me
and
won
t
find
me
and
where
i
am
you
can
t
come
the
jews
therefore
said
among
themselves
where
will
this
man
go
that
we
won
t
find
him
will
he
go
to
the
dispersion
among
the
greeks
and
teach
the
greeks
what
is
this
word
that
he
said
you
will
seek
me
and
won
t
find
me
and
where
i
am
you
can
t
come
now
on
the
last
and
greatest
day
of
the
feast
jesus
stood
and
cried
out
if
anyone
is
thirsty
let
him
come
to
me
and
drink
he
who
believes
in
me
as
the
scripture
has
said
from
within
him
will
flow
rivers
of
living
water
but
he
said
this
about
the
spirit
which
those
believing
in
him
were
to
receive
for
the
holy
spirit
was
not
yet
given
because
jesus
wasn
t
yet
glorified
many
of
the
multitude
therefore
when
they
heard
these
words
said
this
is
truly
the
prophet
others
said
this
is
the
christ
but
some
said
what
does
the
christ
come
out
of
galilee
hasn
t
the
scripture
said
that
the
christ
comes
of
the
seed
of
david
and
from
bethlehem
the
village
where
david
was
so
there
arose
a
division
in
the
multitude
because
of
him
some
of
them
would
have
arrested
him
but
no
one
laid
hands
on
him
the
officers
therefore
came
to
the
chief
priests
and
pharisees
and
they
said
to
them
why
didn
t
you
bring
him
the
officers
answered
no
man
ever
spoke
like
this
man
the
pharisees
therefore
answered
them
you
aren
t
also
led
astray
are
you
have
any
of
the
rulers
believed
in
him
or
of
the
pharisees
but
this
multitude
that
doesn
t
know
the
law
is
accursed
nicodemus
he
who
came
to
him
by
night
being
one
of
them
said
to
them
does
our
law
judge
a
man
unless
it
first
hears
from
him
personally
and
knows
what
he
does
they
answered
him
are
you
also
from
galilee
search
and
see
that
no
prophet
has
arisen
out
of
galilee
everyone
went
to
his
own
house
but
jesus
went
to
the
mount
of
olives
at
early
dawn
he
came
again
into
the
temple
and
all
the
people
came
to
him
he
sat
down
and
taught
them
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
brought
a
woman
taken
in
adultery
having
set
her
in
the
midst
they
told
him
teacher
we
found
this
woman
in
adultery
in
the
very
act
now
in
our
law
moses
commanded
us
to
stone
such
what
then
do
you
say
about
her
they
said
this
testing
him
that
they
might
have
something
to
accuse
him
of
but
jesus
stooped
down
and
wrote
on
the
ground
with
his
finger
but
when
they
continued
asking
him
he
looked
up
and
said
to
them
he
who
is
without
sin
among
you
let
him
throw
the
first
stone
at
her
again
he
stooped
down
and
with
his
finger
wrote
on
the
ground
they
when
they
heard
it
being
convicted
by
their
conscience
went
out
one
by
one
beginning
from
the
oldest
even
to
the
last
jesus
was
left
alone
with
the
woman
where
she
was
in
the
middle
jesus
standing
up
saw
her
and
said
woman
where
are
your
accusers
did
no
one
condemn
you
she
said
no
one
lord
jesus
said
neither
do
i
condemn
you
go
your
way
from
now
on
sin
no
more
again
therefore
jesus
spoke
to
them
saying
i
am
the
light
of
the
world
he
who
follows
me
will
not
walk
in
the
darkness
but
will
have
the
light
of
life
the
pharisees
therefore
said
to
him
you
testify
about
yourself
your
testimony
is
not
valid
jesus
answered
them
even
if
i
testify
about
myself
my
testimony
is
true
for
i
know
where
i
came
from
and
where
i
am
going
but
you
don
t
know
where
i
came
from
or
where
i
am
going
you
judge
according
to
the
flesh
i
judge
no
one
even
if
i
do
judge
my
judgment
is
true
for
i
am
not
alone
but
i
am
with
the
father
who
sent
me
it
s
also
written
in
your
law
that
the
testimony
of
two
people
is
valid
i
am
one
who
testifies
about
myself
and
the
father
who
sent
me
testifies
about
me
they
said
therefore
to
him
where
is
your
father
jesus
answered
you
know
neither
me
nor
my
father
if
you
knew
me
you
would
know
my
father
also
jesus
spoke
these
words
in
the
treasury
as
he
taught
in
the
temple
yet
no
one
arrested
him
because
his
hour
had
not
yet
come
jesus
said
therefore
again
to
them
i
am
going
away
and
you
will
seek
me
and
you
will
die
in
your
sins
where
i
go
you
can
t
come
the
jews
therefore
said
will
he
kill
himself
that
he
says
where
i
am
going
you
can
t
come
he
said
to
them
you
are
from
beneath
i
am
from
above
you
are
of
this
world
i
am
not
of
this
world
i
said
therefore
to
you
that
you
will
die
in
your
sins
for
unless
you
believe
that
i
am
he
you
will
die
in
your
sins
they
said
therefore
to
him
who
are
you
jesus
said
to
them
just
what
i
have
been
saying
to
you
from
the
beginning
i
have
many
things
to
speak
and
to
judge
concerning
you
however
he
who
sent
me
is
true
and
the
things
which
i
heard
from
him
these
i
say
to
the
world
they
didn
t
understand
that
he
spoke
to
them
about
the
father
jesus
therefore
said
to
them
when
you
have
lifted
up
the
son
of
man
then
you
will
know
that
i
am
he
and
i
do
nothing
of
myself
but
as
my
father
taught
me
i
say
these
things
he
who
sent
me
is
with
me
the
father
hasn
t
left
me
alone
for
i
always
do
the
things
that
are
pleasing
to
him
as
he
spoke
these
things
many
believed
in
him
jesus
therefore
said
to
those
jews
who
had
believed
him
if
you
remain
in
my
word
then
you
are
truly
my
disciples
you
will
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
will
make
you
free
they
answered
him
we
are
abraham
s
seed
and
have
never
been
in
bondage
to
anyone
how
do
you
say
you
will
be
made
free
jesus
answered
them
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
everyone
who
commits
sin
is
the
bondservant
of
sin
a
bondservant
doesn
t
live
in
the
house
forever
a
son
remains
forever
if
therefore
the
son
makes
you
free
you
will
be
free
indeed
i
know
that
you
are
abraham
s
seed
yet
you
seek
to
kill
me
because
my
word
finds
no
place
in
you
i
say
the
things
which
i
have
seen
with
my
father
and
you
also
do
the
things
which
you
have
seen
with
your
father
they
answered
him
our
father
is
abraham
jesus
said
to
them
if
you
were
abraham
s
children
you
would
do
the
works
of
abraham
but
now
you
seek
to
kill
me
a
man
who
has
told
you
the
truth
which
i
heard
from
god
abraham
didn
t
do
this
you
do
the
works
of
your
father
they
said
to
him
we
were
not
born
of
sexual
immorality
we
have
one
father
god
therefore
jesus
said
to
them
if
god
were
your
father
you
would
love
me
for
i
came
out
and
have
come
from
god
for
i
haven
t
come
of
myself
but
he
sent
me
why
don
t
you
understand
my
speech
because
you
can
t
hear
my
word
you
are
of
your
father
the
devil
and
you
want
to
do
the
desires
of
your
father
he
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
and
doesn
t
stand
in
the
truth
because
there
is
no
truth
in
him
when
he
speaks
a
lie
he
speaks
on
his
own
for
he
is
a
liar
and
the
father
of
it
but
because
i
tell
the
truth
you
don
t
believe
me
which
of
you
convicts
me
of
sin
if
i
tell
the
truth
why
do
you
not
believe
me
he
who
is
of
god
hears
the
words
of
god
for
this
cause
you
don
t
hear
because
you
are
not
of
god
then
the
jews
answered
him
don
t
we
say
well
that
you
are
a
samaritan
and
have
a
demon
jesus
answered
i
don
t
have
a
demon
but
i
honor
my
father
and
you
dishonor
me
but
i
don
t
seek
my
own
glory
there
is
one
who
seeks
and
judges
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
if
a
person
keeps
my
word
he
will
never
see
death
then
the
jews
said
to
him
now
we
know
that
you
have
a
demon
abraham
died
and
the
prophets
and
you
say
if
a
man
keeps
my
word
he
will
never
taste
of
death
are
you
greater
than
our
father
abraham
who
died
the
prophets
died
who
do
you
make
yourself
out
to
be
jesus
answered
if
i
glorify
myself
my
glory
is
nothing
it
is
my
father
who
glorifies
me
of
whom
you
say
that
he
is
our
god
you
have
not
known
him
but
i
know
him
if
i
said
i
don
t
know
him
i
would
be
like
you
a
liar
but
i
know
him
and
keep
his
word
your
father
abraham
rejoiced
to
see
my
day
he
saw
it
and
was
glad
the
jews
therefore
said
to
him
you
are
not
yet
fifty
years
old
and
have
you
seen
abraham
jesus
said
to
them
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
before
abraham
came
into
existence
i
am
therefore
they
took
up
stones
to
throw
at
him
but
jesus
was
hidden
and
went
out
of
the
temple
having
gone
through
the
midst
of
them
and
so
passed
by
as
he
passed
by
he
saw
a
man
blind
from
birth
his
disciples
asked
him
rabbi
who
sinned
this
man
or
his
parents
that
he
was
born
blind
jesus
answered
neither
did
this
man
sin
nor
his
parents
but
that
the
works
of
god
might
be
revealed
in
him
i
must
work
the
works
of
him
who
sent
me
while
it
is
day
the
night
is
coming
when
no
one
can
work
while
i
am
in
the
world
i
am
the
light
of
the
world
when
he
had
said
this
he
spat
on
the
ground
made
mud
with
the
saliva
anointed
the
blind
man
s
eyes
with
the
mud
and
said
to
him
go
wash
in
the
pool
of
siloam
which
means
sent
so
he
went
away
washed
and
came
back
seeing
the
neighbors
therefore
and
those
who
saw
that
he
was
blind
before
said
isn
t
this
he
who
sat
and
begged
others
were
saying
it
is
he
still
others
were
saying
he
looks
like
him
he
said
i
am
he
they
therefore
were
asking
him
how
were
your
eyes
opened
he
answered
a
man
called
jesus
made
mud
anointed
my
eyes
and
said
to
me
go
to
the
pool
of
siloam
and
wash
so
i
went
away
and
washed
and
i
received
sight
then
they
asked
him
where
is
he
he
said
i
don
t
know
they
brought
him
who
had
been
blind
to
the
pharisees
it
was
a
sabbath
when
jesus
made
the
mud
and
opened
his
eyes
again
therefore
the
pharisees
also
asked
him
how
he
received
his
sight
he
said
to
them
he
put
mud
on
my
eyes
i
washed
and
i
see
some
therefore
of
the
pharisees
said
this
man
is
not
from
god
because
he
doesn
t
keep
the
sabbath
others
said
how
can
a
man
who
is
a
sinner
do
such
signs
there
was
division
among
them
therefore
they
asked
the
blind
man
again
what
do
you
say
about
him
because
he
opened
your
eyes
he
said
he
is
a
prophet
the
jews
therefore
did
not
believe
concerning
him
that
he
had
been
blind
and
had
received
his
sight
until
they
called
the
parents
of
him
who
had
received
his
sight
and
asked
them
is
this
your
son
who
you
say
was
born
blind
how
then
does
he
now
see
his
parents
answered
them
we
know
that
this
is
our
son
and
that
he
was
born
blind
but
how
he
now
sees
we
don
t
know
or
who
opened
his
eyes
we
don
t
know
he
is
of
age
ask
him
he
will
speak
for
himself
his
parents
said
these
things
because
they
feared
the
jews
for
the
jews
had
already
agreed
that
if
any
man
would
confess
him
as
christ
he
would
be
put
out
of
the
synagogue
therefore
his
parents
said
he
is
of
age
ask
him
so
they
called
the
man
who
was
blind
a
second
time
and
said
to
him
give
glory
to
god
we
know
that
this
man
is
a
sinner
he
therefore
answered
i
don
t
know
if
he
is
a
sinner
one
thing
i
do
know
that
though
i
was
blind
now
i
see
they
said
to
him
again
what
did
he
do
to
you
how
did
he
open
your
eyes
he
answered
them
i
told
you
already
and
you
didn
t
listen
why
do
you
want
to
hear
it
again
you
don
t
also
want
to
become
his
disciples
do
you
they
insulted
him
and
said
you
are
his
disciple
but
we
are
disciples
of
moses
we
know
that
god
has
spoken
to
moses
but
as
for
this
man
we
don
t
know
where
he
comes
from
the
man
answered
them
how
amazing
you
don
t
know
where
he
comes
from
yet
he
opened
my
eyes
we
know
that
god
doesn
t
listen
to
sinners
but
if
anyone
is
a
worshipper
of
god
and
does
his
will
he
listens
to
him
since
the
world
began
it
has
never
been
heard
of
that
anyone
opened
the
eyes
of
someone
born
blind
if
this
man
were
not
from
god
he
could
do
nothing
they
answered
him
you
were
altogether
born
in
sins
and
do
you
teach
us
they
threw
him
out
jesus
heard
that
they
had
thrown
him
out
and
finding
him
he
said
do
you
believe
in
the
son
of
god
he
answered
who
is
he
lord
that
i
may
believe
in
him
jesus
said
to
him
you
have
both
seen
him
and
it
is
he
who
speaks
with
you
he
said
lord
i
believe
and
he
worshiped
him
jesus
said
i
came
into
this
world
for
judgment
that
those
who
don
t
see
may
see
and
that
those
who
see
may
become
blind
those
of
the
pharisees
who
were
with
him
heard
these
things
and
said
to
him
are
we
also
blind
jesus
said
to
them
if
you
were
blind
you
would
have
no
sin
but
now
you
say
we
see
therefore
your
sin
remains
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
one
who
doesn
t
enter
by
the
door
into
the
sheep
fold
but
climbs
up
some
other
way
the
same
is
a
thief
and
a
robber
but
one
who
enters
in
by
the
door
is
the
shepherd
of
the
sheep
the
gatekeeper
opens
the
gate
for
him
and
the
sheep
listen
to
his
voice
he
calls
his
own
sheep
by
name
and
leads
them
out
whenever
he
brings
out
his
own
sheep
he
goes
before
them
and
the
sheep
follow
him
for
they
know
his
voice
they
will
by
no
means
follow
a
stranger
but
will
flee
from
him
for
they
don
t
know
the
voice
of
strangers
jesus
spoke
this
parable
to
them
but
they
didn
t
understand
what
he
was
telling
them
jesus
therefore
said
to
them
again
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
i
am
the
sheep
s
door
all
who
came
before
me
are
thieves
and
robbers
but
the
sheep
didn
t
listen
to
them
i
am
the
door
if
anyone
enters
in
by
me
he
will
be
saved
and
will
go
in
and
go
out
and
will
find
pasture
the
thief
only
comes
to
steal
kill
and
destroy
i
came
that
they
may
have
life
and
may
have
it
abundantly
i
am
the
good
shepherd
the
good
shepherd
lays
down
his
life
for
the
sheep
he
who
is
a
hired
hand
and
not
a
shepherd
who
doesn
t
own
the
sheep
sees
the
wolf
coming
leaves
the
sheep
and
flees
the
wolf
snatches
the
sheep
and
scatters
them
the
hired
hand
flees
because
he
is
a
hired
hand
and
doesn
t
care
for
the
sheep
i
am
the
good
shepherd
i
know
my
own
and
i
m
known
by
my
own
even
as
the
father
knows
me
and
i
know
the
father
i
lay
down
my
life
for
the
sheep
i
have
other
sheep
which
are
not
of
this
fold
i
must
bring
them
also
and
they
will
hear
my
voice
they
will
become
one
flock
with
one
shepherd
therefore
the
father
loves
me
because
i
lay
down
my
life
that
i
may
take
it
again
no
one
takes
it
away
from
me
but
i
lay
it
down
by
myself
i
have
power
to
lay
it
down
and
i
have
power
to
take
it
again
i
received
this
commandment
from
my
father
therefore
a
division
arose
again
among
the
jews
because
of
these
words
many
of
them
said
he
has
a
demon
and
is
insane
why
do
you
listen
to
him
others
said
these
are
not
the
sayings
of
one
possessed
by
a
demon
it
isn
t
possible
for
a
demon
to
open
the
eyes
of
the
blind
is
it
it
was
the
feast
of
the
dedication
at
jerusalem
it
was
winter
and
jesus
was
walking
in
the
temple
in
solomon
s
porch
the
jews
therefore
came
around
him
and
said
to
him
how
long
will
you
hold
us
in
suspense
if
you
are
the
christ
tell
us
plainly
jesus
answered
them
i
told
you
and
you
don
t
believe
the
works
that
i
do
in
my
father
s
name
these
testify
about
me
but
you
don
t
believe
because
you
are
not
of
my
sheep
as
i
told
you
my
sheep
hear
my
voice
and
i
know
them
and
they
follow
me
i
give
eternal
life
to
them
they
will
never
perish
and
no
one
will
snatch
them
out
of
my
hand
my
father
who
has
given
them
to
me
is
greater
than
all
no
one
is
able
to
snatch
them
out
of
my
father
s
hand
i
and
the
father
are
one
therefore
jews
took
up
stones
again
to
stone
him
jesus
answered
them
i
have
shown
you
many
good
works
from
my
father
for
which
of
those
works
do
you
stone
me
the
jews
answered
him
we
don
t
stone
you
for
a
good
work
but
for
blasphemy
because
you
being
a
man
make
yourself
god
jesus
answered
them
isn
t
it
written
in
your
law
i
said
you
are
gods
if
he
called
them
gods
to
whom
the
word
of
god
came
and
the
scripture
can
t
be
broken
do
you
say
of
him
whom
the
father
sanctified
and
sent
into
the
world
you
blaspheme
because
i
said
i
am
the
son
of
god
if
i
don
t
do
the
works
of
my
father
don
t
believe
me
but
if
i
do
them
though
you
don
t
believe
me
believe
the
works
that
you
may
know
and
believe
that
the
father
is
in
me
and
i
in
the
father
they
sought
again
to
seize
him
and
he
went
out
of
their
hand
he
went
away
again
beyond
the
jordan
into
the
place
where
john
was
baptizing
at
first
and
there
he
stayed
many
came
to
him
they
said
john
indeed
did
no
sign
but
everything
that
john
said
about
this
man
is
true
many
believed
in
him
there
now
a
certain
man
was
sick
lazarus
from
bethany
of
the
village
of
mary
and
her
sister
martha
it
was
that
mary
who
had
anointed
the
lord
with
ointment
and
wiped
his
feet
with
her
hair
whose
brother
lazarus
was
sick
the
sisters
therefore
sent
to
him
saying
lord
behold
he
for
whom
you
have
great
affection
is
sick
but
when
jesus
heard
it
he
said
this
sickness
is
not
to
death
but
for
the
glory
of
god
that
god
s
son
may
be
glorified
by
it
now
jesus
loved
martha
and
her
sister
and
lazarus
when
therefore
he
heard
that
he
was
sick
he
stayed
two
days
in
the
place
where
he
was
then
after
this
he
said
to
the
disciples
let
s
go
into
judea
again
the
disciples
told
him
rabbi
the
jews
were
just
trying
to
stone
you
and
are
you
going
there
again
jesus
answered
aren
t
there
twelve
hours
of
daylight
if
a
man
walks
in
the
day
he
doesn
t
stumble
because
he
sees
the
light
of
this
world
but
if
a
man
walks
in
the
night
he
stumbles
because
the
light
isn
t
in
him
he
said
these
things
and
after
that
he
said
to
them
our
friend
lazarus
has
fallen
asleep
but
i
am
going
so
that
i
may
awake
him
out
of
sleep
the
disciples
therefore
said
lord
if
he
has
fallen
asleep
he
will
recover
now
jesus
had
spoken
of
his
death
but
they
thought
that
he
spoke
of
taking
rest
in
sleep
so
jesus
said
to
them
plainly
then
lazarus
is
dead
i
am
glad
for
your
sakes
that
i
was
not
there
so
that
you
may
believe
nevertheless
let
s
go
to
him
thomas
therefore
who
is
called
didymus
said
to
his
fellow
disciples
let
s
go
also
that
we
may
die
with
him
so
when
jesus
came
he
found
that
he
had
been
in
the
tomb
four
days
already
now
bethany
was
near
jerusalem
about
fifteen
stadia
away
many
of
the
jews
had
joined
the
women
around
martha
and
mary
to
console
them
concerning
their
brother
then
when
martha
heard
that
jesus
was
coming
she
went
and
met
him
but
mary
stayed
in
the
house
therefore
martha
said
to
jesus
lord
if
you
would
have
been
here
my
brother
wouldn
t
have
died
even
now
i
know
that
whatever
you
ask
of
god
god
will
give
you
jesus
said
to
her
your
brother
will
rise
again
martha
said
to
him
i
know
that
he
will
rise
again
in
the
resurrection
at
the
last
day
jesus
said
to
her
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
who
believes
in
me
though
he
die
yet
will
he
live
whoever
lives
and
believes
in
me
will
never
die
do
you
believe
this
she
said
to
him
yes
lord
i
have
come
to
believe
that
you
are
the
christ
god
s
son
he
who
comes
into
the
world
when
she
had
said
this
she
went
away
and
called
mary
her
sister
secretly
saying
the
teacher
is
here
and
is
calling
you
when
she
heard
this
she
arose
quickly
and
went
to
him
now
jesus
had
not
yet
come
into
the
village
but
was
in
the
place
where
martha
met
him
then
the
jews
who
were
with
her
in
the
house
and
were
consoling
her
when
they
saw
mary
that
she
rose
up
quickly
and
went
out
followed
her
saying
she
is
going
to
the
tomb
to
weep
there
therefore
when
mary
came
to
where
jesus
was
and
saw
him
she
fell
down
at
his
feet
saying
to
him
lord
if
you
would
have
been
here
my
brother
wouldn
t
have
died
when
jesus
therefore
saw
her
weeping
and
the
jews
weeping
who
came
with
her
he
groaned
in
the
spirit
and
was
troubled
and
said
where
have
you
laid
him
they
told
him
lord
come
and
see
jesus
wept
the
jews
therefore
said
see
how
much
affection
he
had
for
him
some
of
them
said
couldn
t
this
man
who
opened
the
eyes
of
him
who
was
blind
have
also
kept
this
man
from
dying
jesus
therefore
again
groaning
in
himself
came
to
the
tomb
now
it
was
a
cave
and
a
stone
lay
against
it
jesus
said
take
away
the
stone
martha
the
sister
of
him
who
was
dead
said
to
him
lord
by
this
time
there
is
a
stench
for
he
has
been
dead
four
days
jesus
said
to
her
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
if
you
believed
you
would
see
god
s
glory
so
they
took
away
the
stone
from
the
place
where
the
dead
man
was
lying
jesus
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
said
father
i
thank
you
that
you
listened
to
me
i
know
that
you
always
listen
to
me
but
because
of
the
multitude
that
stands
around
i
said
this
that
they
may
believe
that
you
sent
me
when
he
had
said
this
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
lazarus
come
out
he
who
was
dead
came
out
bound
hand
and
foot
with
wrappings
and
his
face
was
wrapped
around
with
a
cloth
jesus
said
to
them
free
him
and
let
him
go
therefore
many
of
the
jews
who
came
to
mary
and
saw
what
jesus
did
believed
in
him
but
some
of
them
went
away
to
the
pharisees
and
told
them
the
things
which
jesus
had
done
the
chief
priests
therefore
and
the
pharisees
gathered
a
council
and
said
what
are
we
doing
for
this
man
does
many
signs
if
we
leave
him
alone
like
this
everyone
will
believe
in
him
and
the
romans
will
come
and
take
away
both
our
place
and
our
nation
but
a
certain
one
of
them
caiaphas
being
high
priest
that
year
said
to
them
you
know
nothing
at
all
nor
do
you
consider
that
it
is
advantageous
for
us
that
one
man
should
die
for
the
people
and
that
the
whole
nation
not
perish
now
he
didn
t
say
this
of
himself
but
being
high
priest
that
year
he
prophesied
that
jesus
would
die
for
the
nation
and
not
for
the
nation
only
but
that
he
might
also
gather
together
into
one
the
children
of
god
who
are
scattered
abroad
so
from
that
day
forward
they
took
counsel
that
they
might
put
him
to
death
jesus
therefore
walked
no
more
openly
among
the
jews
but
departed
from
there
into
the
country
near
the
wilderness
to
a
city
called
ephraim
he
stayed
there
with
his
disciples
now
the
passover
of
the
jews
was
at
hand
many
went
up
from
the
country
to
jerusalem
before
the
passover
to
purify
themselves
then
they
sought
for
jesus
and
spoke
one
with
another
as
they
stood
in
the
temple
what
do
you
think
that
he
isn
t
coming
to
the
feast
at
all
now
the
chief
priests
and
the
pharisees
had
commanded
that
if
anyone
knew
where
he
was
he
should
report
it
that
they
might
seize
him
then
six
days
before
the
passover
jesus
came
to
bethany
where
lazarus
was
who
had
been
dead
whom
he
raised
from
the
dead
so
they
made
him
a
supper
there
martha
served
but
lazarus
was
one
of
those
who
sat
at
the
table
with
him
mary
therefore
took
a
pound
of
ointment
of
pure
nard
very
precious
and
anointed
the
feet
of
jesus
and
wiped
his
feet
with
her
hair
the
house
was
filled
with
the
fragrance
of
the
ointment
then
judas
iscariot
simon
s
son
one
of
his
disciples
who
would
betray
him
said
why
wasn
t
this
ointment
sold
for
three
hundred
denarii
and
given
to
the
poor
now
he
said
this
not
because
he
cared
for
the
poor
but
because
he
was
a
thief
and
having
the
money
box
used
to
steal
what
was
put
into
it
but
jesus
said
leave
her
alone
she
has
kept
this
for
the
day
of
my
burial
for
you
always
have
the
poor
with
you
but
you
don
t
always
have
me
a
large
crowd
therefore
of
the
jews
learned
that
he
was
there
and
they
came
not
for
jesus
sake
only
but
that
they
might
see
lazarus
also
whom
he
had
raised
from
the
dead
but
the
chief
priests
conspired
to
put
lazarus
to
death
also
because
on
account
of
him
many
of
the
jews
went
away
and
believed
in
jesus
on
the
next
day
a
great
multitude
had
come
to
the
feast
when
they
heard
that
jesus
was
coming
to
jerusalem
they
took
the
branches
of
the
palm
trees
and
went
out
to
meet
him
and
cried
out
hosanna
blessed
is
he
who
comes
in
the
name
of
the
lord
the
king
of
israel
jesus
having
found
a
young
donkey
sat
on
it
as
it
is
written
don
t
be
afraid
daughter
of
zion
behold
your
king
comes
sitting
on
a
donkey
s
colt
his
disciples
didn
t
understand
these
things
at
first
but
when
jesus
was
glorified
then
they
remembered
that
these
things
were
written
about
him
and
that
they
had
done
these
things
to
him
the
multitude
therefore
that
was
with
him
when
he
called
lazarus
out
of
the
tomb
and
raised
him
from
the
dead
was
testifying
about
it
for
this
cause
also
the
multitude
went
and
met
him
because
they
heard
that
he
had
done
this
sign
the
pharisees
therefore
said
among
themselves
see
how
you
accomplish
nothing
behold
the
world
has
gone
after
him
now
there
were
certain
greeks
among
those
that
went
up
to
worship
at
the
feast
these
therefore
came
to
philip
who
was
from
bethsaida
of
galilee
and
asked
him
saying
sir
we
want
to
see
jesus
philip
came
and
told
andrew
and
in
turn
andrew
came
with
philip
and
they
told
jesus
jesus
answered
them
the
time
has
come
for
the
son
of
man
to
be
glorified
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
unless
a
grain
of
wheat
falls
into
the
earth
and
dies
it
remains
by
itself
alone
but
if
it
dies
it
bears
much
fruit
he
who
loves
his
life
will
lose
it
he
who
hates
his
life
in
this
world
will
keep
it
to
eternal
life
if
anyone
serves
me
let
him
follow
me
where
i
am
there
will
my
servant
also
be
if
anyone
serves
me
the
father
will
honor
him
now
my
soul
is
troubled
what
shall
i
say
father
save
me
from
this
time
but
for
this
cause
i
came
to
this
time
father
glorify
your
name
then
there
came
a
voice
out
of
the
sky
saying
i
have
both
glorified
it
and
will
glorify
it
again
the
multitude
therefore
who
stood
by
and
heard
it
said
that
it
had
thundered
others
said
an
angel
has
spoken
to
him
jesus
answered
this
voice
hasn
t
come
for
my
sake
but
for
your
sakes
now
is
the
judgment
of
this
world
now
the
prince
of
this
world
will
be
cast
out
and
i
if
i
am
lifted
up
from
the
earth
will
draw
all
people
to
myself
but
he
said
this
signifying
by
what
kind
of
death
he
should
die
the
multitude
answered
him
we
have
heard
out
of
the
law
that
the
christ
remains
forever
how
do
you
say
the
son
of
man
must
be
lifted
up
who
is
this
son
of
man
jesus
therefore
said
to
them
yet
a
little
while
the
light
is
with
you
walk
while
you
have
the
light
that
darkness
doesn
t
overtake
you
he
who
walks
in
the
darkness
doesn
t
know
where
he
is
going
while
you
have
the
light
believe
in
the
light
that
you
may
become
sons
of
light
jesus
said
these
things
and
he
departed
and
hid
himself
from
them
but
though
he
had
done
so
many
signs
before
them
yet
they
didn
t
believe
in
him
that
the
word
of
isaiah
the
prophet
might
be
fulfilled
which
he
spoke
lord
who
has
believed
our
report
to
whom
has
the
arm
of
the
lord
been
revealed
for
this
cause
they
couldn
t
believe
for
isaiah
said
again
he
has
blinded
their
eyes
and
he
hardened
their
heart
lest
they
should
see
with
their
eyes
and
perceive
with
their
heart
and
would
turn
and
i
would
heal
them
isaiah
said
these
things
when
he
saw
his
glory
and
spoke
of
him
nevertheless
even
of
the
rulers
many
believed
in
him
but
because
of
the
pharisees
they
didn
t
confess
it
so
that
they
wouldn
t
be
put
out
of
the
synagogue
for
they
loved
men
s
praise
more
than
god
s
praise
jesus
cried
out
and
said
whoever
believes
in
me
believes
not
in
me
but
in
him
who
sent
me
he
who
sees
me
sees
him
who
sent
me
i
have
come
as
a
light
into
the
world
that
whoever
believes
in
me
may
not
remain
in
the
darkness
if
anyone
listens
to
my
sayings
and
doesn
t
believe
i
don
t
judge
him
for
i
came
not
to
judge
the
world
but
to
save
the
world
he
who
rejects
me
and
doesn
t
receive
my
sayings
has
one
who
judges
him
the
word
that
i
spoke
the
same
will
judge
him
in
the
last
day
for
i
spoke
not
from
myself
but
the
father
who
sent
me
he
gave
me
a
commandment
what
i
should
say
and
what
i
should
speak
i
know
that
his
commandment
is
eternal
life
the
things
therefore
which
i
speak
even
as
the
father
has
said
to
me
so
i
speak
now
before
the
feast
of
the
passover
jesus
knowing
that
his
time
had
come
that
he
would
depart
from
this
world
to
the
father
having
loved
his
own
who
were
in
the
world
he
loved
them
to
the
end
after
supper
the
devil
having
already
put
into
the
heart
of
judas
iscariot
simon
s
son
to
betray
him
jesus
knowing
that
the
father
had
given
all
things
into
his
hands
and
that
he
came
forth
from
god
and
was
going
to
god
arose
from
supper
and
laid
aside
his
outer
garments
he
took
a
towel
and
wrapped
a
towel
around
his
waist
then
he
poured
water
into
the
basin
and
began
to
wash
the
disciples
feet
and
to
wipe
them
with
the
towel
that
was
wrapped
around
him
then
he
came
to
simon
peter
he
said
to
him
lord
do
you
wash
my
feet
jesus
answered
him
you
don
t
know
what
i
am
doing
now
but
you
will
understand
later
peter
said
to
him
you
will
never
wash
my
feet
jesus
answered
him
if
i
don
t
wash
you
you
have
no
part
with
me
simon
peter
said
to
him
lord
not
my
feet
only
but
also
my
hands
and
my
head
jesus
said
to
him
someone
who
has
bathed
only
needs
to
have
his
feet
washed
but
is
completely
clean
you
are
clean
but
not
all
of
you
for
he
knew
him
who
would
betray
him
therefore
he
said
you
are
not
all
clean
so
when
he
had
washed
their
feet
put
his
outer
garment
back
on
and
sat
down
again
he
said
to
them
do
you
know
what
i
have
done
to
you
you
call
me
teacher
and
lord
you
say
so
correctly
for
so
i
am
if
i
then
the
lord
and
the
teacher
have
washed
your
feet
you
also
ought
to
wash
one
another
s
feet
for
i
have
given
you
an
example
that
you
also
should
do
as
i
have
done
to
you
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
a
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
lord
neither
one
who
is
sent
greater
than
he
who
sent
him
if
you
know
these
things
blessed
are
you
if
you
do
them
i
don
t
speak
concerning
all
of
you
i
know
whom
i
have
chosen
but
that
the
scripture
may
be
fulfilled
he
who
eats
bread
with
me
has
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me
from
now
on
i
tell
you
before
it
happens
that
when
it
happens
you
may
believe
that
i
am
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
he
who
receives
whomever
i
send
receives
me
and
he
who
receives
me
receives
him
who
sent
me
when
jesus
had
said
this
he
was
troubled
in
spirit
and
testified
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
that
one
of
you
will
betray
me
the
disciples
looked
at
one
another
perplexed
about
whom
he
spoke
one
of
his
disciples
whom
jesus
loved
was
at
the
table
leaning
against
jesus
breast
simon
peter
therefore
beckoned
to
him
and
said
to
him
tell
us
who
it
is
of
whom
he
speaks
he
leaning
back
as
he
was
on
jesus
breast
asked
him
lord
who
is
it
jesus
therefore
answered
it
is
he
to
whom
i
will
give
this
piece
of
bread
when
i
have
dipped
it
so
when
he
had
dipped
the
piece
of
bread
he
gave
it
to
judas
the
son
of
simon
iscariot
after
the
piece
of
bread
then
satan
entered
into
him
then
jesus
said
to
him
what
you
do
do
quickly
now
no
man
at
the
table
knew
why
he
said
this
to
him
for
some
thought
because
judas
had
the
money
box
that
jesus
said
to
him
buy
what
things
we
need
for
the
feast
or
that
he
should
give
something
to
the
poor
therefore
having
received
that
morsel
he
went
out
immediately
it
was
night
when
he
had
gone
out
jesus
said
now
the
son
of
man
has
been
glorified
and
god
has
been
glorified
in
him
if
god
has
been
glorified
in
him
god
will
also
glorify
him
in
himself
and
he
will
glorify
him
immediately
little
children
i
will
be
with
you
a
little
while
longer
you
will
seek
me
and
as
i
said
to
the
jews
where
i
am
going
you
can
t
come
so
now
i
tell
you
a
new
commandment
i
give
to
you
that
you
love
one
another
just
like
i
have
loved
you
that
you
also
love
one
another
by
this
everyone
will
know
that
you
are
my
disciples
if
you
have
love
for
one
another
simon
peter
said
to
him
lord
where
are
you
going
jesus
answered
where
i
am
going
you
can
t
follow
now
but
you
will
follow
afterwards
peter
said
to
him
lord
why
can
t
i
follow
you
now
i
will
lay
down
my
life
for
you
jesus
answered
him
will
you
lay
down
your
life
for
me
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
the
rooster
won
t
crow
until
you
have
denied
me
three
times
don
t
let
your
heart
be
troubled
believe
in
god
believe
also
in
me
in
my
father
s
house
are
many
mansions
if
it
weren
t
so
i
would
have
told
you
i
am
going
to
prepare
a
place
for
you
if
i
go
and
prepare
a
place
for
you
i
will
come
again
and
will
receive
you
to
myself
that
where
i
am
you
may
be
there
also
where
i
go
you
know
and
you
know
the
way
thomas
says
to
him
lord
we
don
t
know
where
you
are
going
how
can
we
know
the
way
jesus
said
to
him
i
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
no
one
comes
to
the
father
except
through
me
if
you
had
known
me
you
would
have
known
my
father
also
from
now
on
you
know
him
and
have
seen
him
philip
said
to
him
lord
show
us
the
father
and
that
will
be
enough
for
us
jesus
said
to
him
have
i
been
with
you
such
a
long
time
and
do
you
not
know
me
philip
he
who
has
seen
me
has
seen
the
father
how
do
you
say
show
us
the
father
don
t
you
believe
that
i
am
in
the
father
and
the
father
in
me
the
words
that
i
tell
you
i
speak
not
from
myself
but
the
father
who
lives
in
me
does
his
works
believe
me
that
i
am
in
the
father
and
the
father
in
me
or
else
believe
me
for
the
very
works
sake
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
he
who
believes
in
me
the
works
that
i
do
he
will
do
also
and
greater
works
than
these
will
he
do
because
i
am
going
to
my
father
whatever
you
will
ask
in
my
name
that
will
i
do
that
the
father
may
be
glorified
in
the
son
if
you
will
ask
anything
in
my
name
i
will
do
it
if
you
love
me
keep
my
commandments
i
will
pray
to
the
father
and
he
will
give
you
another
counselor
that
he
may
be
with
you
forever
the
spirit
of
truth
whom
the
world
can
t
receive
for
it

t
see
him

him

him
for
he

with
you
and

be
in
you
i
will
not
leave
you
orphans
i
will
come
to
you

a
little
while

me
because

live
also
in
that
day
you
will
know
that
i
am
in
my
father
and
you
in
me
and
i
in
you
one
who

my
commandments
and

them

person

judas

said
to
him
lord
what
has
happened
that
you
are
about
to
reveal
yourself
to
us
and
not
to
the
world
jesus
answered
him
if
a
man
loves
me
he
will
keep
my
word
my
father
will
love
him
and
we
will
come
to

words

said
to
you
peace
i
leave
with
you
my
peace
i
give
to
you
not
as
the
world
gives
give
i
to
you
don
t
let
your
heart
be
troubled
neither
let
it
be
fearful
you
heard
how
i
told
you
i
go
away
and
i
come
to
you
if
you
loved
me
you
would
have
rejoiced
because
i
said
i
am
going
to
my
father
for
the
father
is
greater
than
i
now
i
have
told
you
before
it
happens
so
that
when
it
happens
you
may
believe
i
will
no
more
speak
much
with
you
for
the
prince
of
the
world
comes
and
he
has
nothing
in
me
but
that
the
world
may
know
that
i
love
the
father
and
as
the
father
commanded
me
even
so
i
do
arise
let
us
go
from
here
i
am
the
true
vine
and
my
father
is
the
farmer
every
branch
in
me
that
doesn
t
bear
fruit
he
takes
away
every
branch
that
bears
fruit
he
prunes
that
it
may
bear
more
fruit
you
are
already
pruned
clean
because
of
the
word
which
i
have
spoken
to
you
remain
in
me
and
i
in
you
as
the
branch
can
t
bear
fruit
by
itself
unless
it
remains
in
the
vine
so
neither
can
you
unless
you
remain
in
me
i
am
the
vine
you
are
the
branches
he
who
remains
in
me
and
i
in
him
the
same
bears
much
fruit
for
apart
from
me
you
can
do
nothing
if
a
man
doesn
t
remain
in
me
he
is
thrown
out
as
a
branch
and
is
withered
and
they
gather
them
throw
them
into
the
fire
and
they
are
burned
if
you
remain
in
me
and
my
words
remain
in
you
you
will
ask
whatever
you
desire
and
it
will
be
done
to
you
in
this
is
my
father
glorified
that
you
bear
much
fruit
and
so
you
will
be
my
disciples
even
as
the
father
has
loved
me
i
also
have
loved
you
remain
in
my
love
if
you
keep
my
commandments
you
will
remain
in
my
love
even
as
i
have
kept
my
father
s
commandments
and
remain
in
his
love
i
have
spoken
these
things
to
you
that
my
joy
may
remain
in
you
and
that
your
joy
may
be
made
full
this
is
my
commandment
that
you
love
one
another
even
as
i
have
loved
you
greater
love
has
no
one
than
this
that
someone
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friends
you
are
my
friends
if
you
do
whatever
i
command
you
no
longer
do
i
call
you
servants
for
the
servant
doesn
t
know
what
his
lord
does
but
i
have
called
you
friends
for
everything
that
i
heard
from
my
father
i
have
made
known
to
you
you
didn
t
choose
me
but
i
chose
you
and
appointed
you
that
you
should
go
and
bear
fruit
and
that
your
fruit
should
remain
that
whatever
you
will
ask
of
the
father
in
my
name
he
may
give
it
to
you
i
command
these
things
to
you
that
you
may
love
one
another
if
the
world
hates
you
you
know
that
it
has
hated
me
before
it
hated
you
if
you
were
of
the
world
the
world
would
love
its
own
but
because
you
are
not
of
the
world
since
i
chose
you
out
of
the
world
therefore
the
world
hates
you
remember
the
word
that
i
said
to
you
a
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
lord
if
they
persecuted
me
they
will
also
persecute
you
if
they
kept
my
word
they
will
keep
yours
also
but
all
these
things
will
they
do
to
you
for
my
name
s
sake
because
they
don
t
know
him
who
sent
me
if
i
had
not
come
and
spoken
to
them
they
would
not
have
had
sin
but
now
they
have
no
excuse
for
their
sin
he
who
hates
me
hates
my
father
also
if
i
hadn
t
done
among
them
the
works
which
no
one
else
did
they
wouldn
t
have
had
sin
but
now
have
they
seen
and
also
hated
both
me
and
my
father
but
this
happened
so
that
the
word
may
be
fulfilled
which
was
written
in
their
law
they
hated
me
without
a
cause
when
the
counselor
has
come
whom
i
will
send
to
you
from
the
father
the
spirit
of
truth
who
proceeds
from
the
father
he
will
testify
about
me
you
will
also
testify
because
you
have
been
with
me
from
the
beginning
these
things
have
i
spoken
to
you
so
that
you
wouldn
t
be
caused
to
stumble
they
will
put
you
out
of
the
synagogues
yes
the
time
comes
that
whoever
kills
you
will
think
that
he
offers
service
to
god
they
will
do
these
things
because
they
have
not
known
the
father
nor
me
but
i
have
told
you
these
things
so
that
when
the
time
comes
you
may
remember
that
i
told
you
about
them
i
didn
t
tell
you
these
things
from
the
beginning
because
i
was
with
you
but
now
i
am
going
to
him
who
sent
me
and
none
of
you
asks
me
where
are
you
going
but
because
i
have
told
you
these
things
sorrow
has
filled
your
heart
nevertheless
i
tell
you
the
truth
it
is
to
your
advantage
that
i
go
away
for
if
i
don
t
go
away
the
counselor
won
t
come
to
you
but
if
i
go
i
will
send
him
to
you
when
he
has
come
he
will
convict
the
world
about
sin
about
righteousness
and
about
judgment
about
sin
because
they
don
t
believe
in
me
about
righteousness
because
i
am
going
to
my
father
and
you
won
t
see
me
any
more
about
judgment
because
the
prince
of
this
world
has
been
judged
i
have
yet
many
things
to
tell
you
but
you
can
t
bear
them
now
however
when
he
the
spirit
of
truth
has
come
he
will
guide
you
into
all
truth
for
he
will
not
speak
from
himself
but
whatever
he
hears
he
will
speak
he
will
declare
to
you
things
that
are
coming
he
will
glorify
me
for
he
will
take
from
what
is
mine
and
will
declare
it
to
you
all
things
whatever
the
father
has
are
mine
therefore
i
said
that
he
takes
of
mine
and
will
declare
it
to
you
a
little
while
and
you
will
not
see
me
again
a
little
while
and
you
will
see
me
some
of
his
disciples
therefore
said
to
one
another
what
is
this
that
he
says
to
us
a
little
while
and
you
won
t
see
me
and
again
a
little
while
and
you
will
see
me
and
because
i
go
to
the
father
they
said
therefore
what
is
this
that
he
says
a
little
while
we
don
t
know
what
he
is
saying
therefore
jesus
perceived
that
they
wanted
to
ask
him
and
he
said
to
them
do
you
inquire
among
yourselves
concerning
this
that
i
said
a
little
while
and
you
won
t
see
me
and
again
a
little
while
and
you
will
see
me
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
that
you
will
weep
and
lament
but
the
world
will
rejoice
you
will
be
sorrowful
but
your
sorrow
will
be
turned
into
joy
a
woman
when
she
gives
birth
has
sorrow
because
her
time
has
come
but
when
she
has
delivered
the
child
she
doesn
t
remember
the
anguish
any
more
for
the
joy
that
a
human
being
is
born
into
the
world
therefore
you
now
have
sorrow
but
i
will
see
you
again
and
your
heart
will
rejoice
and
no
one
will
take
your
joy
away
from
you
in
that
day
you
will
ask
me
no
questions
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
whatever
you
may
ask
of
the
father
in
my
name
he
will
give
it
to
you
until
now
you
have
asked
nothing
in
my
name
ask
and
you
will
receive
that
your
joy
may
be
made
full
i
have
spoken
these
things
to
you
in
figures
of
speech
but
the
time
is
coming
when
i
will
no
more
speak
to
you
in
figures
of
speech
but
will
tell
you
plainly
about
the
father
in
that
day
you
will
ask
in
my
name
and
i
don
t
say
to
you
that
i
will
pray
to
the
father
for
you
for
the
father
himself
loves
you
because
you
have
loved
me
and
have
believed
that
i
came
forth
from
god
i
came
out
from
the
father
and
have
come
into
the
world
again
i
leave
the
world
and
go
to
the
father
his
disciples
said
to
him
behold
now
you
speak
plainly
and
speak
no
figures
of
speech
now
we
know
that
you
know
all
things
and
don
t
need
for
anyone
to
question
you
by
this
we
believe
that
you
came
forth
from
god
jesus
answered
them
do
you
now
believe
behold
the
time
is
coming
yes
and
has
now
come
that
you
will
be
scattered
everyone
to
his
own
place
and
you
will
leave
me
alone
yet
i
am
not
alone
because
the
father
is
with
me
i
have
told
you
these
things
that
in
me
you
may
have
peace
in
the
world
you
have
oppression
but
cheer
up
i
have
overcome
the
world
jesus
said
these
things
and
lifting
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
he
said
father
the
time
has
come
glorify
your
son
that
your
son
may
also
glorify
you
even
as
you
gave
him
authority
over
all
flesh
to
give
eternal
life
to
all
whom
you
have
given
him
this
is
eternal
life
that
they
should
know
you
the
only
true
god
and
him
whom
you
sent
jesus
christ
i
glorified
you
on
the
earth
i
have
accomplished
the
work
which
you
have
given
me
to
do
now
father
glorify
me
with
your
own
self
with
the
glory
which
i
had
with
you
before
the
world
existed
i
revealed
your
name
to
the
people
whom
you
have
given
me
out
of
the
world
they
were
yours
and
you
have
given
them
to
me
they
have
kept
your
word
now
they
have
known
that
all
things
whatever
you
have
given
me
are
from
you
for
the
words
which
you
have
given
me
i
have
given
to
them
and
they
received
them
and
knew
for
sure
that
i
came
forth
from
you
and
they
have
believed
that
you
sent
me
i
pray
for
them
i
don
t
pray
for
the
world
but
for
those
whom
you
have
given
me
for
they
are
yours
all
things
that
are
mine
are
yours
and
yours
are
mine
and
i
am
glorified
in
them
i
am
no
more
in
the
world
but
these
are
in
the
world
and
i
am
coming
to
you
holy
father
keep
them
through
your
name
which
you
have
given
me
that
they
may
be
one
even
as
we
are
while
i
was
with
them
in
the
world
i
kept
them
in
your
name
those
whom
you
have
given
me
i
have
kept
none
of
them
is
lost
except
the
son
of
perdition
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled
but
now
i
come
to
you
and
i
say
these
things
in
the
world
that
they
may
have
my
joy
made
full
in
themselves
i
have
given
them
your
word
the
world
hated
them
because
they
are
not
of
the
world
even
as
i
am
not
of
the
world
i
pray
not
that
you
would
take
them
from
the
world
but
that
you
would
keep
them
from
the
evil
one
they
are
not
of
the
world
even
as
i
am
not
of
the
world
sanctify
them
in
your
truth
your
word
is
truth
as
you
sent
me
into
the
world
even
so
i
have
sent
them
into
the
world
for
their
sakes
i
sanctify
myself
that
they
themselves
also
may
be
sanctified
in
truth
not
for
these
only
do
i
pray
but
for
those
also
who
believe
in
me
through
their
word
that
they
may
all
be
one
even
as
you
father
are
in
me
and
i
in
you
that
they
also
may
be
one
in
us
that
the
world
may
believe
that
you
sent
me
the
glory
which
you
have
given
me
i
have
given
to
them
that
they
may
be
one
even
as
we
are
one
i
in
them
and
you
in
me
that
they
may
be
perfected
into
one
that
the
world
may
know
that
you
sent
me
and
loved
them
even
as
you
loved
me
father
i
desire
that
they
also
whom
you
have
given
me
be
with
me
where
i
am
that
they
may
see
my
glory
which
you
have
given
me
for
you
loved
me
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
righteous
father
the
world
hasn
t
known
you
but
i
knew
you
and
these
knew
that
you
sent
me
i
made
known
to
them
your
name
and
will
make
it
known
that
the
love
with
which
you
loved
me
may
be
in
them
and
i
in
them
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
he
went
out
with
his
disciples
over
the
brook
kidron
where
was
a
garden
into
which
he
and
his
disciples
entered
now
judas
who
betrayed
him
also
knew
the
place
for
jesus
often
resorted
there
with
his
disciples
judas
then
having
taken
a
detachment
of
soldiers
and
officers
from
the
chief
priests
and
the
pharisees
came
there
with
lanterns
torches
and
weapons
jesus
therefore
knowing
all
the
things
that
were
happening
to
him
went
forth
and
said
to
them
who
are
you
looking
for
they
answered
him
jesus
of
nazareth
jesus
said
to
them
i
am
judas
also
who
betrayed
him
was
standing
with
them
when
therefore
he
said
to
them
i
am
they
went
backward
and
fell
to
the
ground
again
therefore
he
asked
them
who
are
you
looking
for
they
said
jesus
of
nazareth
jesus
answered
i
told
you
that
i
am
if
therefore
you
seek
me
let
these
go
their
way
that
the
word
might
be
fulfilled
which
he
spoke
of
those
whom
you
have
given
me
i
have
lost
none
simon
peter
therefore
having
a
sword
drew
it
and
struck
the
high
priest
s
servant
and
cut
off
his
right
ear
the
servant
s
name
was
malchus
jesus
therefore
said
to
peter
put
the
sword
into
its
sheath
the
cup
which
the
father
has
given
me
shall
i
not
surely
drink
it
so
the
detachment
the
commanding
officer
and
the
officers
of
the
jews
seized
jesus
and
bound
him
and
led
him
to
annas
first
for
he
was
fatherinlaw
to
caiaphas
who
was
high
priest
that
year
now
it
was
caiaphas
who
advised
the
jews
that
it
was
expedient
that
one
man
should
perish
for
the
people
simon
peter
followed
jesus
as
did
another
disciple
now
that
disciple
was
known
to
the
high
priest
and
entered
in
with
jesus
into
the
court
of
the
high
priest
but
peter
was
standing
at
the
door
outside
so
the
other
disciple
who
was
known
to
the
high
priest
went
out
and
spoke
to
her
who
kept
the
door
and
brought
in
peter
then
the
maid
who
kept
the
door
said
to
peter
are
you
also
one
of
this
man
s
disciples
he
said
i
am
not
now
the
servants
and
the
officers
were
standing
there
having
made
a
fire
of
coals
for
it
was
cold
they
were
warming
themselves
peter
was
with
them
standing
and
warming
himself
the
high
priest
therefore
asked
jesus
about
his
disciples
and
about
his
teaching
jesus
answered
him
i
spoke
openly
to
the
world
i
always
taught
in
synagogues
and
in
the
temple
where
the
jews
always
meet
i
said
nothing
in
secret
why
do
you
ask
me
ask
those
who
have
heard
me
what
i
said
to
them
behold
these
know
the
things
which
i
said
when
he
had
said
this
one
of
the
officers
standing
by
slapped
jesus
with
his
hand
saying
do
you
answer
the
high
priest
like
that
jesus
answered
him
if
i
have
spoken
evil
testify
of
the
evil
but
if
well
why
do
you
beat
me
annas
sent
him
bound
to
caiaphas
the
high
priest
now
simon
peter
was
standing
and
warming
himself
they
said
therefore
to
him
you
aren
t
also
one
of
his
disciples
are
you
he
denied
it
and
said
i
am
not
one
of
the
servants
of
the
high
priest
being
a
relative
of
him
whose
ear
peter
had
cut
off
said
didn
t
i
see
you
in
the
garden
with
him
peter
therefore
denied
it
again
and
immediately
the
rooster
crowed
they
led
jesus
therefore
from
caiaphas
into
the
praetorium
it
was
early
and
they
themselves
didn
t
enter
into
the
praetorium
that
they
might
not
be
defiled
but
might
eat
the
passover
pilate
therefore
went
out
to
them
and
said
what
accusation
do
you
bring
against
this
man
they
answered
him
if
this
man
weren
t
an
evildoer
we
wouldn
t
have
delivered
him
up
to
you
pilate
therefore
said
to
them
take
him
yourselves
and
judge
him
according
to
your
law
therefore
the
jews
said
to
him
it
is
not
lawful
for
us
to
put
anyone
to
death
that
the
word
of
jesus
might
be
fulfilled
which
he
spoke
signifying
by
what
kind
of
death
he
should
die
pilate
therefore
entered
again
into
the
praetorium
called
jesus
and
said
to
him
are
you
the
king
of
the
jews
jesus
answered
him
do
you
say
this
by
yourself
or
did
others
tell
you
about
me
pilate
answered
i
m
not
a
jew
am
i
your
own
nation
and
the
chief
priests
delivered
you
to
me
what
have
you
done
jesus
answered
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
if
my
kingdom
were
of
this
world
then
my
servants
would
fight
that
i
wouldn
t
be
delivered
to
the
jews
but
now
my
kingdom
is
not
from
here
pilate
therefore
said
to
him
are
you
a
king
then
jesus
answered
you
say
that
i
am
a
king
for
this
reason
i
have
been
born
and
for
this
reason
i
have
come
into
the
world
that
i
should
testify
to
the
truth
everyone
who
is
of
the
truth
listens
to
my
voice
pilate
said
to
him
what
is
truth
when
he
had
said
this
he
went
out
again
to
the
jews
and
said
to
them
i
find
no
basis
for
a
charge
against
him
but
you
have
a
custom
that
i
should
release
someone
to
you
at
the
passover
therefore
do
you
want
me
to
release
to
you
the
king
of
the
jews
then
they
all
shouted
again
saying
not
this
man
but
barabbas
now
barabbas
was
a
robber
so
pilate
then
took
jesus
and
flogged
him
the
soldiers
twisted
thorns
into
a
crown
and
put
it
on
his
head
and
dressed
him
in
a
purple
garment
they
kept
saying
hail
king
of
the
jews
and
they
kept
slapping
him
then
pilate
went
out
again
and
said
to
them
behold
i
bring
him
out
to
you
that
you
may
know
that
i
find
no
basis
for
a
charge
against
him
jesus
therefore
came
out
wearing
the
crown
of
thorns
and
the
purple
garment
pilate
said
to
them
behold
the
man
when
therefore
the
chief
priests
and
the
officers
saw
him
they
shouted
saying
crucify
crucify
pilate
said
to
them
take
him
yourselves
and
crucify
him
for
i
find
no
basis
for
a
charge
against
him
the
jews
answered
him
we
have
a
law
and
by
our
law
he
ought
to
die
because
he
made
himself
the
son
of
god
when
therefore
pilate
heard
this
saying
he
was
more
afraid
he
entered
into
the
praetorium
again
and
said
to
jesus
where
are
you
from
but
jesus
gave
him
no
answer
pilate
therefore
said
to
him
aren
t
you
speaking
to
me
don
t
you
know
that
i
have
power
to
release
you
and
have
power
to
crucify
you
jesus
answered
you
would
have
no
power
at
all
against
me
unless
it
were
given
to
you
from
above
therefore
he
who
delivered
me
to
you
has
greater
sin
at
this
pilate
was
seeking
to
release
him
but
the
jews
cried
out
saying
if
you
release
this
man
you
aren
t
caesar
s
friend
everyone
who
makes
himself
a
king
speaks
against
caesar
when
pilate
therefore
heard
these
words
he
brought
jesus
out
and
sat
down
on
the
judgment
seat
at
a
place
called
the
pavement
but
in
hebrew
gabbatha
now
it
was
the
preparation
day
of
the
passover
at
about
the
sixth
hour
he
said
to
the
jews
behold
your
king
they
cried
out
away
with
him
away
with
him
crucify
him
pilate
said
to
them
shall
i
crucify
your
king
the
chief
priests
answered
we
have
no
king
but
caesar
so
then
he
delivered
him
to
them
to
be
crucified
so
they
took
jesus
and
led
him
away
he
went
out
bearing
his
cross
to
the
place
called
the
place
of
a
skull
which
is
called
in
hebrew
golgotha
where
they
crucified
him
and
with
him
two
others
on
either
side
one
and
jesus
in
the
middle
pilate
wrote
a
title
also
and
put
it
on
the
cross
there
was
written
jesus
of
nazareth
the
king
of
the
jews
therefore
many
of
the
jews
read
this
title
for
the
place
where
jesus
was
crucified
was
near
the
city
and
it
was
written
in
hebrew
in
latin
and
in
greek
the
chief
priests
of
the
jews
therefore
said
to
pilate
don
t
write
the
king
of
the
jews
but
he
said
i
am
king
of
the
jews
pilate
answered
what
i
have
written
i
have
written
then
the
soldiers
when
they
had
crucified
jesus
took
his
garments
and
made
four
parts
to
every
soldier
a
part
and
also
the
coat
now
the
coat
was
without
seam
woven
from
the
top
throughout
then
they
said
to
one
another
let
s
not
tear
it
but
cast
lots
for
it
to
decide
whose
it
will
be
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled
which
says
they
parted
my
garments
among
them
for
my
cloak
they
cast
lots
therefore
the
soldiers
did
these
things
but
there
were
standing
by
the
cross
of
jesus
his
mother
and
his
mother
s
sister
mary
the
wife
of
clopas
and
mary
magdalene
therefore
when
jesus
saw
his
mother
and
the
disciple
whom
he
loved
standing
there
he
said
to
his
mother
woman
behold
your
son
then
he
said
to
the
disciple
behold
your
mother
from
that
hour
the
disciple
took
her
to
his
own
home
after
this
jesus
seeing
that
all
things
were
now
finished
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled
said
i
am
thirsty
now
a
vessel
full
of
vinegar
was
set
there
so
they
put
a
sponge
full
of
the
vinegar
on
hyssop
and
held
it
at
his
mouth
when
jesus
therefore
had
received
the
vinegar
he
said
it
is
finished
he
bowed
his
head
and
gave
up
his
spirit
therefore
the
jews
because
it
was
the
preparation
day
so
that
the
bodies
wouldn
t
remain
on
the
cross
on
the
sabbath
for
that
sabbath
was
a
special
one
asked
of
pilate
that
their
legs
might
be
broken
and
that
they
might
be
taken
away
therefore
the
soldiers
came
and
broke
the
legs
of
the
first
and
of
the
other
who
was
crucified
with
him
but
when
they
came
to
jesus
and
saw
that
he
was
already
dead
they
didn
t
break
his
legs
however
one
of
the
soldiers
pierced
his
side
with
a
spear
and
immediately
blood
and
water
came
out
he
who
has
seen
has
testified
and
his
testimony
is
true
he
knows
that
he
tells
the
truth
that
you
may
believe
for
these
things
happened
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled
a
bone
of
him
will
not
be
broken
again
another
scripture
says
they
will
look
on
him
whom
they
pierced
after
these
things
joseph
of
arimathaea
being
a
disciple
of
jesus
but
secretly
for
fear
of
the
jews
asked
of
pilate
that
he
might
take
away
jesus
body
pilate
gave
him
permission
he
came
therefore
and
took
away
his
body
nicodemus
who
at
first
came
to
jesus
by
night
also
came
bringing
a
mixture
of
myrrh
and
aloes
about
a
hundred
roman
pounds
so
they
took
jesus
body
and
bound
it
in
linen
cloths
with
the
spices
as
the
custom
of
the
jews
is
to
bury
now
in
the
place
where
he
was
crucified
there
was
a
garden
in
the
garden
a
new
tomb
in
which
no
man
had
ever
yet
been
laid
then
because
of
the
jews
preparation
day
for
the
tomb
was
near
at
hand
they
laid
jesus
there
now
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
mary
magdalene
went
early
while
it
was
still
dark
to
the
tomb
and
saw
the
stone
taken
away
from
the
tomb
therefore
she
ran
and
came
to
simon
peter
and
to
the
other
disciple
whom
jesus
loved
and
said
to
them
they
have
taken
away
the
lord
out
of
the
tomb
and
we
don
t
know
where
they
have
laid
him
therefore
peter
and
the
other
disciple
went
out
and
they
went
toward
the
tomb
they
both
ran
together
the
other
disciple
outran
peter
and
came
to
the
tomb
first
stooping
and
looking
in
he
saw
the
linen
cloths
lying
yet
he
didn
t
enter
in
then
simon
peter
came
following
him
and
entered
into
the
tomb
he
saw
the
linen
cloths
lying
and
the
cloth
that
had
been
on
his
head
not
lying
with
the
linen
cloths
but
rolled
up
in
a
place
by
itself
so
then
the
other
disciple
who
came
first
to
the
tomb
also
entered
in
and
he
saw
and
believed
for
as
yet
they
didn
t
know
the
scripture
that
he
must
rise
from
the
dead
so
the
disciples
went
away
again
to
their
own
homes
but
mary
was
standing
outside
at
the
tomb
weeping
so
as
she
wept
she
stooped
and
looked
into
the
tomb
and
she
saw
two
angels
in
white
sitting
one
at
the
head
and
one
at
the
feet
where
the
body
of
jesus
had
lain
they
told
her
woman
why
are
you
weeping
she
said
to
them
because
they
have
taken
away
my
lord
and
i
don
t
know
where
they
have
laid
him
when
she
had
said
this
she
turned
around
and
saw
jesus
standing
and
didn
t
know
that
it
was
jesus
jesus
said
to
her
woman
why
are
you
weeping
who
are
you
looking
for
she
supposing
him
to
be
the
gardener
said
to
him
sir
if
you
have
carried
him
away
tell
me
where
you
have
laid
him
and
i
will
take
him
away
jesus
said
to
her
mary
she
turned
and
said
to
him
rhabbouni
which
is
to
say
teacher
jesus
said
to
her
don
t
touch
me
for
i
haven
t
yet
ascended
to
my
father
but
go
to
my
brothers
and
tell
them
i
am
ascending
to
my
father
and
your
father
to
my
god
and
your
god
mary
magdalene
came
and
told
the
disciples
that
she
had
seen
the
lord
and
that
he
had
said
these
things
to
her
when
therefore
it
was
evening
on
that
day
the
first
day
of
the
week
and
when
the
doors
were
locked
where
the
disciples
were
assembled
for
fear
of
the
jews
jesus
came
and
stood
in
the
midst
and
said
to
them
peace
be
to
you
when
he
had
said
this
he
showed
them
his
hands
and
his
side
the
disciples
therefore
were
glad
when
they
saw
the
lord
jesus
therefore
said
to
them
again
peace
be
to
you
as
the
father
has
sent
me
even
so
i
send
you
when
he
had
said
this
he
breathed
on
them
and
said
to
them
receive
the
holy
spirit
whoever
s
sins
you
forgive
they
are
forgiven
them
whoever
s
sins
you
retain
they
have
been
retained
but
thomas
one
of
the
twelve
called
didymus
wasn
t
with
them
when
jesus
came
the
other
disciples
therefore
said
to
him
we
have
seen
the
lord
but
he
said
to
them
unless
i
see
in
his
hands
the
print
of
the
nails
and
put
my
hand
into
his
side
i
will
not
believe
after
eight
days
again
his
disciples
were
inside
and
thomas
was
with
them
jesus
came
the
doors
being
locked
and
stood
in
the
midst
and
said
peace
be
to
you
then
he
said
to
thomas
reach
here
your
finger
and
see
my
hands
reach
here
your
hand
and
put
it
into
my
side
don
t
be
unbelieving
but
believing
thomas
answered
him
my
lord
and
my
god
jesus
said
to
him
because
you
have
seen
me
you
have
believed
blessed
are
those
who
have
not
seen
and
have
believed
therefore
jesus
did
many
other
signs
in
the
presence
of
his
disciples
which
are
not
written
in
this
book
but
these
are
written
that
you
may
believe
that
jesus
is
the
christ
the
son
of
god
and
that
believing
you
may
have
life
in
his
name
after
these
things
jesus
revealed
himself
again
to
the
disciples
at
the
sea
of
tiberias
he
revealed
himself
this
way
simon
peter
thomas
called
didymus
nathanael
of
cana
in
galilee
and
the
sons
of
zebedee
and
two
others
of
his
disciples
were
together
simon
peter
said
to
them
i
m
going
fishing
they
told
him
we
are
also
coming
with
you
they
immediately
went
out
and
entered
into
the
boat
that
night
they
caught
nothing
but
when
day
had
already
come
jesus
stood
on
the
beach
yet
the
disciples
didn
t
know
that
it
was
jesus
jesus
therefore
said
to
them
children
have
you
anything
to
eat
they
answered
him
no
he
said
to
them
cast
the
net
on
the
right
side
of
the
boat
and
you
will
find
some
they
cast
it
therefore
and
now
they
weren
t
able
to
draw
it
in
for
the
multitude
of
fish
that
disciple
therefore
whom
jesus
loved
said
to
peter
it
s
the
lord
so
when
simon
peter
heard
that
it
was
the
lord
he
wrapped
his
coat
around
him
for
he
was
naked
and
threw
himself
into
the
sea
but
the
other
disciples
came
in
the
little
boat
for
they
were
not
far
from
the
land
but
about
two
hundred
cubits
away
dragging
the
net
full
of
fish
so
when
they
got
out
on
the
land
they
saw
a
fire
of
coals
there
and
fish
laid
on
it
and
bread
jesus
said
to
them
bring
some
of
the
fish
which
you
have
just
caught
simon
peter
went
up
and
drew
the
net
to
land
full
of
great
fish
one
hundred
fiftythree
and
even
though
there
were
so
many
the
net
wasn
t
torn
jesus
said
to
them
come
and
eat
breakfast
none
of
the
disciples
dared
inquire
of
him
who
are
you
knowing
that
it
was
the
lord
then
jesus
came
and
took
the
bread
gave
it
to
them
and
the
fish
likewise
this
is
now
the
third
time
that
jesus
was
revealed
to
his
disciples
after
he
had
risen
from
the
dead
so
when
they
had
eaten
their
breakfast
jesus
said
to
simon
peter
simon
son
of
jonah
do
you
love
me
more
than
these
he
said
to
him
yes
lord
you
know
that
i
have
affection
for
you
he
said
to
him
feed
my
lambs
he
said
to
him
again
a
second
time
simon
son
of
jonah
do
you
love
me
he
said
to
him
yes
lord
you
know
that
i
have
affection
for
you
he
said
to
him
tend
my
sheep
he
said
to
him
the
third
time
simon
son
of
jonah
do
you
have
affection
for
me
peter
was
grieved
because
he
asked
him
the
third
time
do
you
have
affection
for
me
he
said
to
him
lord
you
know
everything
you
know
that
i
have
affection
for
you
jesus
said
to
him
feed
my
sheep
most
assuredly
i
tell
you
when
you
were
young
you
dressed
yourself
and
walked
where
you
wanted
to
but
when
you
are
old
you
will
stretch
out
your
hands
and
another
will
dress
you
and
carry
you
where
you
don
t
want
to
go
now
he
said
this
signifying
by
what
kind
of
death
he
would
glorify
god
when
he
had
said
this
he
said
to
him
follow
me
then
peter
turning
around
saw
a
disciple
following
this
was
the
disciple
whom
jesus
sincerely
loved
the
one
who
had
also
leaned
on
jesus
breast
at
the
supper
and
asked
lord
who
is
going
to
betray
you
peter
seeing
him
said
to
jesus
lord
what
about
this
man
jesus
said
to
him
if
i
desire
that
he
stay
until
i
come
what
is
that
to
you
you
follow
me
this
saying
therefore
went
out
among
the
brothers
that
this
disciple
wouldn
t
die
yet
jesus
didn
t
say
to
him
that
he
wouldn
t
die
but
if
i
desire
that
he
stay
until
i
come
what
is
that
to
you
this
is
the
disciple
who
testifies
about
these
things
and
wrote
these
things
we
know
that
his
witness
is
true
there
are
also
many
other
things
which
jesus
did
which
if
they
would
all
be
written
i
suppose
that
even
the
world
itself
wouldn
t
have
room
for
the
books
that
would
be
written
